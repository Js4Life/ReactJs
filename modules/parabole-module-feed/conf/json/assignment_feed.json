Paragraph 326-20-55-9 requires that, when the amortized cost basis of a loan has been adjusted under fair value hedge accounting, the effective rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the loan's future cash flows with that adjusted amortized cost basis That paragraph states that the adjustment under fair value hedge accounting of the loan's carrying amount for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk under this Subtopic shall be considered to be an adjustment of the loan's amortized cost basis. As discussed in that paragraph, the loan's original effective interest rate becomes irrelevant once the recorded amount of the loan is adjusted for any changes in its fair value. Because paragraph 815-25-35-10 requires that the loan's carrying amount be adjusted for hedge accounting before the requirements of Subtopic 326-20 310-10 are applied, this Subtopic implicitly supports using the new effective rate and the adjusted amortized cost basis." }

For example, a pool of homogeneous loans may initially use a loss-rate method, but certain individual loans no longer may have similar risk characteristics because of credit deterioration. When a financial asset no longer shares similar risk characteristics with the original pool of financial assets, an entity should evaluate that financial asset to determine whether it shares risk characteristics similar to other pools of loans. Expected credit losses of that financial asset should be measured individually if there are no similar risk characteristics with other loans.

Judgment is required to determine the nature, depth, and extent of the analysis required to evaluate the effect of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the historical credit loss information, including qualitative factors. In this circumstance, Entity J notes that U.S. Treasury securities are explicitly fully guaranteed by a sovereign entity that can print its own currency and that the sovereign entity\u2019s currency is routinely held by central banks and other major financial institutions, is used in international commerce, and commonly is viewed as a reserve currency, all of which qualitatively indicate that historical credit loss information should be minimally affected by current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

The amount that satisfies the fair value objective would include consideration of the low likelihood that no payment will be required, but the accrual of the contingent loss under Section 450-20-30 would be based solely on the best estimate of the settlement amount whose payment is probable (the maximum potential settlement amount in this case).

For example, if the timing of either a sale of the financial asset into the secondary market or a sale of collateral in essentially the same condition as received upon foreclosure is indeterminate, the creditor likely does not have the information necessary to reasonably estimate cash flows expected and shall cease recognizing income on the loan financial asset. However, the ability to place a financial asset on nonaccrual shall not be used to circumvent recognition of a credit loss. If the financial asset is acquired primarily for the rewards of ownership of the underlying collateral, accrual of income is inappropriate. Such rewards of ownership would include use of the collateral in operations of the entity or improving the collateral for resale.

On the basis of those factors, Bank C determines adjustments to historical loss information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The remaining expected losses (represented by the shaded cells in the table in paragraph 326-20-55-30 in each respective year) reflect those adjustments, and Bank C arrives at expected losses of 60, 260, 430, and 510 for loans originated in 20X6, 20X7, 20X8, and 20X9, respectively.

Therefore, Bank D estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis for loans that no longer exhibit similar risk characteristics because of credit deterioration. A loss-rate method for estimating expected credit losses on a pooled basis is applied for the loans in the portfolio segment that continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics." }

U.S. Treasury obligations. The unrealized losses on Entity B\u2019s investments in U.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments. Entity B does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that Entity B will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. Federal agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses on Entity B\u2019s investment in federal agency mortgage-backed securities were caused by interest rate increases. Entity B purchased those investments at a discount relative to their face amount, and the contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost bases of Entity B\u2019s investments. Entity B does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that Entity B will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. Corporate bonds. Entity B\u2019s unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to a 150 investment in Entity C\u2019s Series C Debentures. Entity C is a manufacturer. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by a recent decrease in profitability and near-term profit forecasts by industry analysts resulting from intense competitive pricing pressure in the manufacturing industry and a recent sector downgrade by several industry analysts. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit Entity C to settle the security at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. While Entity C\u2019s credit rating has decreased from A to BBB (Standard & Poor\u2019s), Entity B currently does not expect Entity C to settle the debentures at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment (that is, Entity B expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security). Entity B does not intend to sell the investment and it is not more likely than not that Entity B will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis.

For public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years 2. For public business entities that do not meet the definition of an SEC filer, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years 3. For all other entities, including not-for-profit entities and employee benefit plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan accounting, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. b. Early application of the pending content that links to this paragraph is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. c. An entity shall apply the pending content that links to this paragraph by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the pending content that links to this paragraph is effective. d. An entity shall apply prospectively the pending content that links to this paragraph for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration to {add glossary link to 1st definition}financial assets{add glossary link to 1st definition} for which Subtopic 310-30 was previously applied. The prospective application will result in an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to reflect the addition of the allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption. An entity shall not reassess whether recognized financial assets meet the criteria of a purchased financial asset with credit deterioration as of the date of adoption. An entity may elect to maintain pools of {add glossary link to 2nd definition}loans{add glossary link to 2nd definition} accounted for under Subtopic 310-30 at adoption. An entity shall not reassess whether modifications to individual acquired financial assets accounted for in pools are troubled debt restructurings as of the date of adoption. The 100 noncredit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date. The same transition requirements should be applied to beneficial interests for which Subtopic 310-30 was applied previously or for which there is a significant difference between the contractual cash flows and expected cash flows at the date of recognition. e. An entity shall apply prospectively the pending content that links to this paragraph to {add glossary link to 1st definition}debt securities{add glossary link to 1st definition} for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the date of adoption, such that the amortized cost basis (including previous write-downs) of the debt security is unchanged. In addition, the effective interest rate on a security will remain unchanged as a result of the adoption of the pending content that links to this paragraph. Amounts previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the adoption date that relate to improvements in cash flows will continue to be accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the debt security on a level-yield basis. Recoveries of amounts previously written off relating to improvements in cash flows after the date of adoption shall be recorded to income in the period received. f. An entity shall disclose the following in the period that the entity adopts the pending content that links to this paragraph: 1. The nature of the change in accounting principle, including an explanation of the newly adopted accounting principle. 2. The method of applying the change. 3. The effect of the adoption on any line item in the statement of financial position, if material, as of the beginning of the first period for which the pending content that links to this paragraph is effective. Presentation of the effect on financial statement subtotals is not required. 4. The cumulative effect of the change on retained earnings or other components of equity in the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the first period for which the pending content that links to this paragraph is effective. g. An entity that issues interim financial statements shall provide the disclosures in (f) in each interim financial statement of the year of change and the annual financial statement of the period of the change. h. In the year of initial application of the pending content that links to this paragraph, a public business entity that does not meet the definition of a SEC filer may phase-in the disclosure of credit quality indicators by year of origination by only presenting the three most recent origination years (including the first year of adoption). In each subsequent fiscal year, the then-current origination year will be added in the periods after adoption until a total of five origination years are presented. Origination years before those that are presented separately shall be disclosed in the aggregate. For example, the phase-in approach would work as follows assuming a calendar year-end entity: 1. For the first annual reporting period ended December 31, 2X21, after the effective date of January 1, 2X21, an entity would disclose the end of period amortized cost basis of the current period originations within 2X21, as well as the two origination years of 2X20 and 2X19. The December 31, 2X21 end of period amortized cost balances for all prior originations would be presented separately in the aggregate. 2. For the second annual reporting period ended December 31, 2X22, after the effective date of January 1, 2X21, an entity would disclose the end of period amortized cost basis of the current period originations within 2X22, as well as the three origination years of 2X21, 2X20, and 2X19. The December 31, 2X22 ending amortized cost basis would be presented in the aggregate for all origination periods before the four years that are presented separately. 3. For the third annual reporting period ended December 31, 2X23, after the effective date of January 1, 2X21, an entity would disclose the end-of-period amortized cost basis of the current-period originations within 2X23, as well as the four origination years of 2X22, 2X21, 2X20, and 2X19. The December 31, 2X23 ending amortized cost basis would be presented in aggregate for all origination periods before the five years that are presented separately. 4. For interim-period disclosures within the years discussed above, the current year-to-date originations should be disclosed as the originations in the interim reporting period." }

As part of this analysis, Community Bank A observed that real estate values in the community have decreased and the unemployment rate in the community has increased as of the current reporting period date. Based on current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, Community Bank A expects that there will be an additional decrease in real estate values over the next one to two years, and unemployment rates are expected to increase further over the next one to two years. To adjust the historical loss rate to reflect the effects of those differences in current conditions and forecasted changes, Community Bank A estimates a 10-basis-point increase in credit losses incremental to the 1.5 percent historical lifetime loss rate due to the expected decrease in real estate values and a 5-basis-point increase in credit losses incremental to the historical lifetime loss rate due to expected deterioration in unemployment rates. Management estimates the incremental 15-basis-point increase based on its knowledge of historical loss information during past years in which there were similar trends in real estate values and unemployment rates. Management is unable to support its estimate of expectations for real estate values and unemployment rates beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Under this loss-rate method, the incremental credit losses for the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecast (the 15 basis points) is added to the 1.5 percent rate that serves as the basis for the expected credit loss rate. No further reversion adjustments are needed because Community Bank A has applied a 1.65 percent loss rate where it has immediately reverted into historical losses reflective of the contractual term in accordance with paragraphs 326-20-30-8 through 30-9. This approach reflects an immediate reversion technique for the loss-rate method." }

If an entity uses a discounted cash flow method to estimate expected credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the discount rate used should be consistent with the guidance in Section 310-20-35." }
