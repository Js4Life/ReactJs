It is usually difficult, even with hindsight, to identify any single event that \nmade a particular loan uncollectible. However, the concept in GAAP is \n17 \nthat impairment of receivables shall be recognized when, based on all \navailable information, it is probable that a loss has been incurred based \non past events and conditions existing at the date of the financial \nstatements.  \nb. Losses shall not be recognized before it is probable that they have been \nincurred, even though it may be probable based on past experience that \nlosses will be incurred in the future. It is inappropriate to consider \npossible or expected future trends that may lead to additional losses. \nRecognition of losses shall not be deferred to periods after the period in \nwhich the losses have been incurred.  \nc. GAAP does not permit the establishment of allowances that are not \nsupported by appropriate analyses. The approach for determination of \nthe allowance shall be well documented and applied consistently from \nperiod to period.  \nd. Under Subtopic 450-20, the threshold for recognition of impairment shall \nbe the same whether the creditor has many loans or has only one loan. \nParagraph 310-10-35-9 requires that if the conditions of paragraph 450-\n20-25-2 are met, accrual shall be made even though the particular \nreceivables that are uncollectible may not be identifiable.  \ne.

The unrealized losses on Entity A’s investments \nin U.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of U.S. government \n78 \nagencies were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of \nthose investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price \nless than the amortized cost bases of the investments. Because Entity A \ndoes not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that \nEntity A will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their \namortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Entity A does not consider \nthose investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, \n20X3.  \nFederal agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses on Entity \nA’s investment in federal agency mortgage-backed securities were caused \nby interest rate increases. Entity A purchased those investments at a \ndiscount relative to their face amount, and the contractual cash flows of \nthose investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. \nAccordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price \nless than the amortized cost bases of Entity A’s investments. Because the \ndecline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit \nquality, and because Entity A does not intend to sell the investments and it is \nnot more likely than not that Entity A will be required to sell the investments \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Entity \nA does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired \nat December 31, 20X3.  \nCorporate bonds. Entity A’s unrealized loss on investments in corporate \nbonds relates to a $150 investment in Entity B’s Series C Debentures. Entity \nB is a manufacturer. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by a recent \ndecrease in profitability and near-term profit forecasts by industry analysts \nresulting from intense competitive pricing pressure in the manufacturing \nindustry and a recent sector downgrade by several industry analysts. The \ncontractual terms of those investments do not permit Entity B to settle the \nsecurity at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. \nWhile Entity B’s credit rating has decreased from A to BBB (Standard & \nPoor’s), Entity A currently does not expect Entity B to settle the debentures \nat a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment (that is, Entity \nA expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security). \nBecause Entity A does not intend to sell the investment and it is not more \nlikely than not that Entity A will be required to sell the investment before \nrecovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, it does not \nconsider the investment in Entity B’s debentures to be other-than-temporarily \n79 \nAmendments to Subtopic 323-10 \n15.

The unrealized losses on Entity B’s A’s investments in \nU.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies \nwere caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those \ninvestments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than \nthe amortized cost bases of the investments. Because Entity B A does not intend \nto sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that Entity B A will be \nrequired to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, \nwhich may be maturity, Entity A does not consider those investments to be other-\nthan-temporarily impaired at December 31, 20X3.  \nFederal agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses on Entity B’s \nA’s investment in federal agency mortgage-backed securities were caused by \ninterest rate increases. Entity B A purchased those investments at a discount \nrelative to their face amount, and the contractual cash flows of those investments \nare guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. Accordingly, it is expected \nthat the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost \nbases of Entity B’s A’s investments. Because the decline in fair value is \nattributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because Entity \nB A does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that \nEntity B A will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their \namortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Entity A does not consider those \ninvestments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 20X3.  \nCorporate bonds. Entity B’s A’s unrealized loss on investments in corporate \nbonds relates to a $150 investment in Entity C’s B’s Series C Debentures. Entity \nC B is a manufacturer. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by a recent \ndecrease in profitability and near-term profit forecasts by industry analysts \nresulting from intense competitive pricing pressure in the manufacturing industry \n166 \nand a recent sector downgrade by several industry analysts. The contractual \nterms of those investments do not permit Entity C B to settle the security at a \nprice less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. While Entity C’s B’s \ncredit rating has decreased from A to BBB (Standard & Poor’s), Entity B A \ncurrently does not expect Entity C B to settle the debentures at a price less than \nthe amortized cost basis of the investment (that is, Entity B A expects to recover \nthe entire amortized cost basis of the security). Because Entity B A does not \nintend to sell the investment and it is not more likely than not that Entity B A will \nbe required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, \nwhich may be maturity, it does not consider the investment in Entity B’s \ndebentures to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 20X3.  \nAmendments to Subtopic 450-20  \n20.
