It is usually difficult, even with hindsight, to identify any single event that \nmade a particular loan uncollectible. However, the concept in GAAP is \n17 \nthat impairment of receivables shall be recognized when, based on all \navailable information, it is probable that a loss has been incurred based \non past events and conditions existing at the date of the financial \nstatements.  \nb. Losses shall not be recognized before it is probable that they have been \nincurred, even though it may be probable based on past experience that \nlosses will be incurred in the future. It is inappropriate to consider \npossible or expected future trends that may lead to additional losses. \nRecognition of losses shall not be deferred to periods after the period in \nwhich the losses have been incurred.  \nc. GAAP does not permit the establishment of allowances that are not \nsupported by appropriate analyses. The approach for determination of \nthe allowance shall be well documented and applied consistently from \nperiod to period.  \nd. Under Subtopic 450-20, the threshold for recognition of impairment shall \nbe the same whether the creditor has many loans or has only one loan. \nParagraph 310-10-35-9 requires that if the conditions of paragraph 450-\n20-25-2 are met, accrual shall be made even though the particular \nreceivables that are uncollectible may not be identifiable.  \ne.

The unrealized losses on Entity A’s investments \nin U.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of U.S. government \n78 \nagencies were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of \nthose investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price \nless than the amortized cost bases of the investments. Because Entity A \ndoes not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that \nEntity A will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their \namortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Entity A does not consider \nthose investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, \n20X3.  \nFederal agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses on Entity \nA’s investment in federal agency mortgage-backed securities were caused \nby interest rate increases. Entity A purchased those investments at a \ndiscount relative to their face amount, and the contractual cash flows of \nthose investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. \nAccordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price \nless than the amortized cost bases of Entity A’s investments. Because the \ndecline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit \nquality, and because Entity A does not intend to sell the investments and it is \nnot more likely than not that Entity A will be required to sell the investments \nbefore recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Entity \nA does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired \nat December 31, 20X3.  \nCorporate bonds. Entity A’s unrealized loss on investments in corporate \nbonds relates to a $150 investment in Entity B’s Series C Debentures. Entity \nB is a manufacturer. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by a recent \ndecrease in profitability and near-term profit forecasts by industry analysts \nresulting from intense competitive pricing pressure in the manufacturing \nindustry and a recent sector downgrade by several industry analysts. The \ncontractual terms of those investments do not permit Entity B to settle the \nsecurity at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. \nWhile Entity B’s credit rating has decreased from A to BBB (Standard & \nPoor’s), Entity A currently does not expect Entity B to settle the debentures \nat a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment (that is, Entity \nA expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security). \nBecause Entity A does not intend to sell the investment and it is not more \nlikely than not that Entity A will be required to sell the investment before \nrecovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, it does not \nconsider the investment in Entity B’s debentures to be other-than-temporarily \n79 \nAmendments to Subtopic 323-10 \n15.

The unrealized losses on Entity B’s A’s investments in \nU.S. Treasury obligations and direct obligations of U.S. government agencies \nwere caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those \ninvestments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than \nthe amortized cost bases of the investments. Because Entity B A does not intend \nto sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that Entity B A will be \nrequired to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, \nwhich may be maturity, Entity A does not consider those investments to be other-\nthan-temporarily impaired at December 31, 20X3.  \nFederal agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses on Entity B’s \nA’s investment in federal agency mortgage-backed securities were caused by \ninterest rate increases. Entity B A purchased those investments at a discount \nrelative to their face amount, and the contractual cash flows of those investments \nare guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. Accordingly, it is expected \nthat the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost \nbases of Entity B’s A’s investments. Because the decline in fair value is \nattributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because Entity \nB A does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that \nEntity B A will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their \namortized cost bases, which may be maturity, Entity A does not consider those \ninvestments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 20X3.  \nCorporate bonds. Entity B’s A’s unrealized loss on investments in corporate \nbonds relates to a $150 investment in Entity C’s B’s Series C Debentures. Entity \nC B is a manufacturer. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by a recent \ndecrease in profitability and near-term profit forecasts by industry analysts \nresulting from intense competitive pricing pressure in the manufacturing industry \n166 \nand a recent sector downgrade by several industry analysts. The contractual \nterms of those investments do not permit Entity C B to settle the security at a \nprice less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. While Entity C’s B’s \ncredit rating has decreased from A to BBB (Standard & Poor’s), Entity B A \ncurrently does not expect Entity C B to settle the debentures at a price less than \nthe amortized cost basis of the investment (that is, Entity B A expects to recover \nthe entire amortized cost basis of the security). Because Entity B A does not \nintend to sell the investment and it is not more likely than not that Entity B A will \nbe required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, \nwhich may be maturity, it does not consider the investment in Entity B’s \ndebentures to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 20X3.  \nAmendments to Subtopic 450-20  \n20.

Messrs. Kroeker and \nSmith dissented. \n \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith dissent from the issuance of this Accounting \nStandards Update because they disagree with the requirement to recognize a \ncredit loss at origination or purchase, at an amount equal to the “lifetime \nexpected credit loss” for financial assets. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that \nrecognition of lifetime expected credit losses as an expense at inception or \npurchase reflects the risk of loss (that is, credit risk) through the income \nstatement and is inconsistent with the definition of an expense included in FASB \nConcepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements. Messrs. Kroeker \nand Smith believe that this conceptual shortcoming of this Update thereby results \nin financial reporting that does not faithfully reflect the economics of lending \nactivities.  \n \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith acknowledge the overwhelming feedback from \nfinancial statement users that information about lifetime expected losses is a \nsignificant improvement to the information available for the evaluation of financial \nstatements of entities holding financial assets; therefore, they support the \ntransparency provided by the requirement to determine and report lifetime \n236 \nexpected credit losses. However, they would have provided that transparency \ndifferently. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that the transparency of reporting \nlifetime expected credit losses can be provided without recording a Day-1 loss in \na manner that represents a substantial improvement when compared with the \ncurrent accounting requirements as applied under today’s incurred loss model. \nThey believe that there are several models that could have been developed to \nprovide the transparency of providing information about lifetime expected losses \nand improve the existing incurred loss model while reflecting the risk of loss in a \nmanner that attempts to correspond to the compensation for bearing the related \ncredit risk. Consequently, they do not support the issuance of this Update, \ndespite the transparency of providing information about lifetime expected losses, \nbecause the reporting of operating results under the current expected credit loss \nmodel is a poorer reflection of the economics of lending activities than the \nexisting incurred loss model. However, while they disagree with the accounting \nresult as articulated above, they believe that the model developed is operable. \n \nRecording a credit loss at initial recognition (along with a related allowance for \nloan losses) results in a balance sheet presentation that reflects the credit risk \ntwice; it is reflected in the price paid (which is based on the terms of the \ninstrument, including the stated interest rate) and it is reflected in the allowance \nfor loan losses. In an arm’s-length transaction (assuming appropriate diligence in \nunderwriting, absence of fraud, and so forth), whether it is a bank extending \ncredit to a homebuyer or an investor purchasing a debt security or a portfolio of \nloans as an investment, an entity would not be expected to incur an economic \nloss on the day a loan is made or the security is purchased. The loan or debt \nsecurity could be sold at the date of origination or purchased at an amount \nreasonably consistent with the transaction price without incurring a loss. \nNevertheless, the Board specifically acknowledged and agreed to this point in \nparagraph BC81 by incorporating the use of a fair value floor for the allowance \nfor available-for-sale debt securities. Any newly originated or purchased financial \nasset can be sold at fair value to limit recognition of credit losses required by \napplication of this Update that cause the balance (net of allowance) to be less \nthan the fair value of the net asset. This Update contradicts that economic reality \nby requiring the recognition of a loss for taking on risk. This is one reason why \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith disagree with the Board’s conceptual justification of \nthe Day 1 loss model (referenced in paragraph BC42 of this Update). They also \ndisagree with it because the bad-debt expense that is recorded on Day 1 is \ninconsistent with the definition of an expense included in Concepts Statement 6.  \n \nThe absence of an appropriate conceptual justification for the initial \nundervaluation of the asset has the potential to confuse preparers, auditors, and \nusers of financial statements. For example, respondents to the proposed Update \nexpressed the belief that the incremental loss that would be recognized under the \nUpdate is not based on the economics of the transaction but rather on a \n \n237 \nprudential desire to have a higher level of loan loss reserves reflected in financial \nreports to investors. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that requiring an initial \nloss at an amount equal to expected credit losses contradicts the concept of \nneutrality that is fundamental to the FASB’s own Conceptual Framework. They \nare unaware of any other area of financial reporting for which a loss and a related \nvaluation allowance are immediately established to reduce the value of a \nrecognized asset that is purchased or originated on market terms. Messrs. \nKroeker and Smith agree that in the unusual circumstance in which a financial \nasset is purchased at a price that exceeds fair value or is originated with an initial \ninterest rate that is too low considering the degree of credit risk, an initial loss \nand measurement of the asset at an amount below the transaction price likely \nwould be appropriate; in fact, they believe that would be the appropriate \naccounting under today’s incurred loss model. This conceptual shortcoming in \nthe Update may lead some readers to conclude that the Board had a specific \nprudential policy objective when it approved it. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith do not \nbelieve that it is appropriate for the Board to ignore the concept of neutrality in its \nstandards. \n \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that this Update is inconsistent with \nparagraph 41(b) of FASB Concepts Statement No. 7, Using Cash Flow \nInformation and Present Value in Accounting Measurements, which addresses \npresent value (discounted) measures. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith recognize that \nConcepts Statement 7 was written from the perspective of describing the use of \npresent value when arriving at a fair value estimate. Regardless, a fundamental \npremise of Concepts Statement 7 is that when performing a present value \ncalculation of future cash flows, it is inappropriate to reflect credit risk in both the \nexpected future cash flows and the discount rate because doing so effectively \ndouble counts the reflection of credit risk in that present value calculation. If \nestimates of future cash flows reflect the risk of nonpayment, then the discount \nrate should be closer to risk-free. If estimates of future cash flows are based on \ncontractual amounts (and thus do not reflect a nonpayment risk), the discount \nrate should be higher to reflect assumptions about future defaults. However, \nwhen a discounted cash flow method is used, the amendments in this Update \nrequire expected cash flows (that is, contractual cash flows that are adjusted for \nexpected defaults) to be discounted at the loan’s original borrowing rate (which \nby definition reflects assumptions about future defaults).  \n \nToday’s incurred loss model reflects in the statement of financial performance \nlosses that were incurred during the period. The allowance balance, therefore, \nreflects an estimate of past losses even if those losses have not yet been \n“realized.” In contrast, the expected credit loss model in this Update requires \nrecognition of losses (and a corresponding allowance for credit losses) to be \nreflected before those losses are incurred. Therefore, under the expected credit \nloss model, actual credit deterioration would not be reflected in the income \n238 \nstatement in the period of that deterioration unless the loss was unexpected. \nInstead, the loss provision in the performance statement will reflect expected \ncredit losses in the period of origination or acquisition of the financial asset, with \nchanges in expectations reflected in later periods. The result of applying the \nUpdate is that on Day 1 of an origination or purchase, the income statement is \ncharged with an expense so that (assuming expectations of credit losses are \nmet) the future interest income stream will reflect the original contractual (or \npurchased) yield. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that this is an inappropriate \nreflection of the true economics of lending. The compensation for making a loan \nor an investment is in the future streams of cash flows. They believe that a \nchange from the current incurred loss approach to an expected loss approach \nshould be accompanied by a consideration of the way in which compensation for \nbearing credit risk (the credit risk premium embedded in the effective interest \nrate) is recognized. In other words, they believe that both interest income and \nexpected credit losses should be recognized over time. Absent that change, the \nexpected credit loss model results in potentially less meaningful statements of \nfinancial performance for financial statement users.  \n \nOriginating a loan is typically a positive event for a lending institution and in \nsuccessful organizations it is fundamental to long-term profitability. However, \nunder the expected credit loss model, a growing portfolio of loans (whether \nthrough purchase or origination) will have a negative effect on profitability \nbecause of the requirement to record full lifetime expected losses when the loans \nare originated. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith find this result puzzling and \ncounterintuitive. Furthermore, recognizing full lifetime losses on loans (in a \nmanner inconsistent with the underlying economics) could have unintended \nimplications to lending institutions’ willingness to lend under certain \ncircumstances and to certain types of borrowers. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith \nbelieve that this illustrates a significant flaw in the model, which results from the \nlack of neutral financial reporting under the amendments in this Update.  \n \nThe amendments in this Update require that no loss be recorded for expected \ncredit losses for the subset of financial assets for which credit has deteriorated by \na more-than-insignificant amount (since origination) when the assets are \nacquired in a purchase transaction. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith agree with the \napproach for those assets, which is, in effect, the same as the method they \nsuggest should be applied to other financial assets. However, they question why \nit is deemed necessary to require a Day-1 loss at an amount equal to expected \ncredit losses for the vast majority of less risky assets when no such loss is \nrecorded for the riskier credit deteriorated assets. This seems to be an \nacknowledgement that recognition of Day-1 losses is not a fundamentally sound \nbasis of accounting. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith fully support the result of the \nmodel required for assets that have experienced a more-than-insignificant credit \n \n239 \ndeterioration, and they see no reason (conceptually or otherwise) that the model \nshould be applied only to purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. \nThey agree fully with the conclusion of the Board in paragraph BC85 that \n“purchased assets and originated assets should follow the same model.” \nHowever, the amendments in this Update do not accomplish that objective but \nrather establish two models for accounting for purchased financial assets. \n \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that the Update’s requirement to segment all \npurchased loans at the acquisition date and make a determination whether a \nfinancial asset has experienced a “more-than-insignificant credit deterioration” is \noperably difficult and impractical and introduces needless cost and complexity. It \nwill be very difficult for an entity to properly apply the model when large \nacquisitions occur close to the end of a reporting period. Additionally, the \naccounting benefit provided by assessing a loan as a purchased financial asset \nwith credit deterioration (that is, a “PCD” asset with no initial loss recognition) \nintroduces a significant incentive to conclude that there has been some credit \ndeterioration, and setting the threshold at such a low level (that is, more than \ninsignificant) just acerbates the incentive to judge purchased loans as PCD \nassets. Consequently, the amendments in this Update will result in very similar \nloans (originated versus purchased) being accounted for very differently. It also \nwill provide an accounting incentive for entities to change their business model \nfrom a loan origination model to a loan purchase model, although whether that in \nfact happens remains to be seen.  \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that transparent reporting of lifetime expected \ncredit losses is a significant improvement to current incurred loss requirements. \nWhile they disagree with recognizing a loss at inception in an amount equal to \nthe expected credit losses, they believe that a reasonable, cost-effective \napproach could be developed to address their concerns that would better reflect \nthe economics of lending than the model proposed in this Update. \n \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that moving to an expected loss model for \nrecognizing the expected credit losses on financial assets can be justified only if \nthe interest income and the related impairment charge are considered together. \nThey recognize there may be operability difficulties in fully implementing such an \napproach if the objective is to attempt to perfectly reflect a “loss emergence \nperiod.”  However, they believe that the mismatch created by the amendments in \nthis Update can be mitigated. Furthermore, while the IASB considered a similar \nmodel in its November 2009 Exposure Draft, Financial Instruments: Amortised \nCost and Impairment, which was criticized by many as being operationally \ncomplex, they believe that a simplified approach to that model could be \ndeveloped without abandoning the overall objective of reflecting expectations in \nthe measurement of the loss altogether. \n \n240 \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that there are different models that could be \nconsidered, all of which would incorporate the concept of either disclosing or \nincluding on the face of the balance sheet full lifetime expected losses. In any of \nthose models, a method of recording the losses in the income statement would \nhave to be developed. Messrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that developing a \nmodel that incorporates (1) the transparency of displaying full lifetime expected \nlosses and (2) a method of recording interest income along with related expected \ncredit loss provisions would result in a more faithful reflection of the economics of \nlending (under a value realization approach). Contrary to the view of the FASB, \nMessrs. Kroeker and Smith believe that this approach would not create \nsignificantly more operability challenges compared with the model in this Update. \nThey acknowledge some of the operability challenges some people have cited if \nthe objective of the model is to perfectly reflect losses in the income statement \nwhen those losses are incurred. They believe that is one of the most challenging \naspects of the current incurred loss model in GAAP and they would be open to \nthe development of practical expedients that could be applied to ensure that such \na model is implemented in a cost-beneficial way. They observe that this method \nis currently used when applying GAAP to the accounting of loan origination costs \nand that systems already are in place to deal with this accounting that could be \nextended to accommodate credit losses that are estimated at the time that a \nfinancial asset is originated or purchased. They also observe that the \nrequirements of the model included in this Update require this accounting for \npurchased credit deteriorated impaired assets. Thus, the vast majority of entities \nwill be required to implement that system in any case. \n \nMembers of the Financial Accounting Standards Board: \nRussell G. Golden, Chairman  \nJames L. Kroeker, Vice Chairman  \nDaryl E. Buck \nThomas J. Linsmeier \nR. Harold Schroeder \nMarc A. Siegel \nLawrence W. Smith \n \n \n241 \nBackground Information and  \nBasis for Conclusions \nIntroduction \nBC1. The following summarizes the Board’s considerations in reaching the \nconclusions in this Update. It includes reasons for accepting certain approaches \nand rejecting others. Individual Board members gave greater weight to some \nfactors than to others. Throughout the following, the term model may be used \ninterchangeably with methodology and should not be interpreted to mean a \ncomplex computer application. \nBenefits and Costs \nBC2. Paragraph OB2 of FASB Concepts Statement No. 8, Conceptual \nFramework for Financial Reporting, Chapter 1, The Objective of General Purpose \nFinancial Reporting, and Chapter 3, Qualitative Characteristics of Useful \nFinancial Information, states the following:  \nThe objective of general purpose financial reporting is to \nprovide financial information about the reporting entity that is \nuseful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other \ncreditors in making decisions about providing resources to the \nentity. Those decisions involve buying, selling, or holding \nequity and debt instruments and providing or settling loans \nand other forms of credit. [Footnote reference omitted.]  \nBC3. The objective of this Update, which is based on the objective of general \npurpose financial reporting, is to provide financial statement users with more \ndecision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial assets \nand other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each \nreporting date. Users criticized previous GAAP because the thresholds required \nto recognize credit losses delayed the recognition until the credit losses were \nprobable, even if an entity may have had an expectation of a future loss. \nDiversity also existed in application of when the “probable” threshold had been \nreached. The combined effect of delayed recognition and diversity resulted in a \nmisalignment between accounting standards and the market’s perception of \ncredit risk as evidenced by a significant disparity in market value as compared \nwith book value of creditors, most evident in stressed economic environments. \nAs a result, users supported an approach for the allowance for credit losses \nbased on management’s expectations of credit losses over the contractual life of \nthe financial assets (considering the effect of prepayments) with an explanation \n242 \nof inputs and assumptions and changes in those inputs and assumptions from \nthe prior reporting period. Also, recognizing the subjective nature of estimating \ncredit losses, users supported additional disclosures that would facilitate users’ \nassessment of management’s initial credit loss estimate for newly originated \nloans as well as subsequent changes to those estimates. \nBC4. In conjunction with the due process that led to the issuance of this \nUpdate, the Board conducted extensive outreach activities with users, preparers, \nand auditors of financial statements to obtain information about specific \ndeficiencies in the previous GAAP accounting requirements for credit losses. \nInput was received both before the project was added to the Board’s technical \nagenda and throughout the project.  \nBC5. The FASB’s Rules of Procedure states that the mission of the FASB is \nto: \nEstablish and improve standards of financial accounting \nand reporting that foster financial reporting by \nnongovernmental entities that provides decision-useful \ninformation to investors and other users of financial reports. \nBC6. In fulfilling that mission, the Board follows certain precepts, including the \nissuing of standards only when the expected benefits of the resulting information \njustify the expected costs. The Board strives to determine that a standard will fill \na significant need and that the costs imposed to meet that standard, as \ncompared with other alternatives, are justified in relation to the overall benefits of \nthe resulting information. The Board’s assessment of the costs and benefits of \nissuing new guidance is unavoidably more qualitative than quantitative because \nthere is no method to objectively measure the costs to implement new guidance \nor to quantify the value of improved information in financial statements. \nBC7. On the basis of extensive due process and significant input received \nfrom financial statement users and preparers, the Board concluded that the \nguidance in this Update will provide users of financial statements with more \ndecision-useful information about the credit risk inherent in financial assets and \nthe change in expected credit losses occurring during the period. The Board \ndeveloped the amendments in this Update to provide users of financial \nstatements with relevant information. The Board expects this updated guidance  \nto accomplish the following: \na. Result in an earlier measurement of credit losses  \nb. Result in greater transparency about the extent of expected credit \nlosses on financial assets held at the reporting date \nc. Improve a user’s ability to understand the realizability of assets held at \neach reporting period  \nd. Improve a user’s ability to understand changes in expected credit losses \nthat have taken place during the period \n \n243 \ne. Improve a user’s ability to understand purchased financial assets with \ncredit deterioration by enhancing the comparability of the reporting with \nthat of originated assets, while also reducing the cost and complexity of \naccounting for those assets \nf. Provide greater transparency to the user in assessing the credit quality \nindicators of a financial asset portfolio and changes in composition of \nthe financial asset portfolio over time. \nBC8. The Board recognizes that the amendments in this Update may require \nsignificant effort for many entities to gather the necessary data for estimating \nexpected credit losses. The Board also recognizes that the guidance will require \nadditional effort to review, audit, and examine financial statements. During the \ncourse of developing the amendments, the Board sought to minimize the cost of \nimplementing the credit loss guidance and its complexity by developing an \napproach that: \na. Permits an entity to utilize its current internal credit-risk management \napproaches and systems as a framework for applying the new \nmeasurement objective  \nb. Does not include multiple measurement objectives that would have \nrequired different measures of credit losses depending on whether \ncredit deterioration for financial assets has occurred for assets \nmeasured on an amortized cost basis \nc. Does not prescribe specific estimation methods to be used in any \nspecific circumstance but, rather, allows an entity to apply judgment to \ndevelop estimation methods that are appropriate, practical, and \nconsistent with the principles of the guidance  \nd. Does not change the guidance for writing off uncollectible assets \ne. Does not change interest income reporting for originated loans on the \nbasis of feedback received that preparers manage and users seek \nseparate reporting of credit risk and interest income separately \nf. Requires an entity to consider forward-looking information rather than \nlimiting consideration to current and past events, at the date of the \nstatement of financial position  \ng. Allows an entity to revert to historical loss information, with a straight-\nline or immediate reversion both being acceptable methods if the \nexpected contractual term of financial assets goes beyond periods for \nwhich reasonable and supportable forecasts can be obtained \nh. Makes targeted improvements to the impairment of available-for-sale \ndebt securities, which was supported by both users and preparers \ni. Provides transition relief for a prospective transition approach for assets \nfor which the guidance in previous GAAP (Subtopic 310-30) had been \napplied and for assets for which an other-than-temporary impairment \nhad been recognized before the effective date. \nBC9. The Board understands that some stakeholders are of the view that a \nrequirement to record the full estimate of expected losses may inhibit lending, \n244 \nparticularly to less creditworthy borrowers or during an economically stressed \nenvironment. However, the amendments in this Update do not change the \neconomics of lending. In other words, the same loss ultimately will be recorded, \nregardless of the accounting requirements. What changes is an accounting \nthreshold for the recognition of credit losses, which affects only the timing of \nwhen to record credit losses, not the ultimate amount realized on the financial \nassets. The guidance on credit losses should provide information that is useful in \nmaking business and economic decisions, and that guidance on credit losses \nshould provide information that faithfully reports the economics of a transaction, \nregardless of any perceived positive or negative impact of reporting that \ninformation in the financial statements (that is, “neutrality”) has on business and \npolicy decisions. This information will assist users in making their own decisions \nbased on the financial information.  \nBC10. Some stakeholders may interpret Topic 326 as recognition guidance; \nhowever, Topic 326 is measurement guidance. The recognition event occurs \nwhen the financial asset is recognized on the statement of financial position \nthrough origination or purchase. Recognition is limited to assets and liabilities \nbecause the conceptual framework places primacy on those accounts. Expenses \nand losses in the Conceptual Framework are secondary because they represent \nchanges in balance sheet accounts. Therefore, an expense is a remeasurement \nof an asset after its recognition. The amendments in this Update provide \nguidance for the measurement of expected credit losses for recognized financial \nassets and off-balance-sheet commitments. Following the Conceptual \nFramework, the measurements of credit losses for recognized financial assets \nare reported in the income statement as an expense.  \nBC11. In this context, the Board observes that Topic 326 better aligns the \naccounting guidance with underwriting decisions because expected losses \n(rather than only incurred losses) generally are considered when underwriting a \nloan or other financial asset. The Board acknowledges that a growing business \ninvolving riskier credits could give rise to measurement of incremental credit \nlosses in the period the loans were originated. However, the Board was \nconcerned about the inconsistency of an accounting standard that measures only \nincurred losses, whereas the underwriting process considers the expectation of \ncredit losses (that is, the economics of a transaction that are reflected in the \nunderwriting are not reflected in an incurred loss accounting model). The Board \nconcluded that it would have been inappropriate to defer credit losses that were \nexpected by the entity, which would result in the recognition of overstated \nfinancial assets.   \nBC12. The Board considered feedback that the cost of implementation will not \nbe known completely until all implementation issues are identified. Although the \nBoard’s entire due process procedures are designed to gather information about \ncosts and benefits, the analysis of costs and benefits is unavoidably more \nqualitative than quantitative. The Board has created a Transition Resource Group \n(TRG) to assist with issues relating to circumstances that arise during \n \n245 \nimplementation. The Board believes that the TRG will be in a position to monitor \nimplementation efforts and provide support as needed. The Board has \nconsidered the role of the TRG when assessing costs and benefits. The Board \nalso observes that the shortcomings of current GAAP create a need for users to \nderive their own estimates of expected credit losses. Therefore, the amendments \nin this Update will reduce costs for users. The Board acknowledges that some of \nthose costs will shift to preparers but notes that the costs to the system as a \nwhole should be reduced because management is in a position to make a more \ninformed estimate based on information used in assessing collectibility and \nunderwriting decisions. The Board made efforts to minimize the costs of \ncompliance for preparers as noted in paragraph BC8. \nBC13. Notwithstanding the potential additional costs described above, the \nBoard concluded that the benefits of more timely measurement of expected \ncredit losses justify the costs.  \nBackground Information \nBC14. In October 2008, as part of a joint approach to dealing with the reporting \nissues arising from the global financial crisis, the FASB and the IASB created the \nFinancial Crisis Advisory Group (FCAG). FCAG considered how improvements in \nfinancial reporting could enhance investors’ confidence in financial markets. In its \nreport issued on July 28, 2009, FCAG identified delayed recognition of losses \nassociated with loans (and other financial instruments) and the complexity of \nmultiple impairment approaches as primary weaknesses in accounting standards \nand application of those standards. FCAG recommended exploring alternatives \nto the incurred loss model that would use more forward-looking information \nbecause the incurred loss model delays recognition of credit losses until it is \nprobable a loss has been incurred. \nBC15. In November 2009, the IASB issued its Exposure Draft, Financial \nInstruments: Amortised Cost and Impairment (the IASB’s original Exposure Draft \non this subject), which proposed requirements for amortized cost measurement \nincluding the impairment of financial assets. That Exposure Draft aimed to \nprovide information about the effective return on a financial asset by allocating \ninterest revenue over the expected life of the asset. To accomplish this objective, \nthe Exposure Draft proposed that an entity should measure the amortized cost at \nthe expected (credit-adjusted) cash flows discounted at the original credit-\nadjusted interest rate (that is, the effective interest rate adjusted for the initial \nexpected credit losses). \nBC16. Certain respondents supported this model because it would have \ndistinguished between the effect of initial estimates of expected credit losses and \nsubsequent changes in those estimates. They noted that such a distinction would \nprovide information about changes in credit risk and the resulting economic \nlosses. Other respondents said the proposal would result in significant \n246 \noperational challenges. In particular, they highlighted challenges with the \nfollowing: \na. Estimating the full expected cash flow for all financial instruments \nb. Applying a credit-adjusted effective interest rate to those cash flow \nestimates \nc. Maintaining information about the initial estimate of expected credit \nlosses.  \nBC17. In May 2010, the FASB issued the proposed Accounting Standards \nUpdate, Accounting for Financial Instruments and Revisions to the Accounting for \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Financial Instruments (Topic 825) \nand Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which included proposals on \nclassification and measurement, credit impairment, and hedge accounting. With \nregard to credit impairment, the Board’s objective was to ensure that the \nallowance balance reflected all estimated credit losses for the remaining life of a \nfinancial instrument. To accomplish that objective, the FASB proposed that an \nentity should measure credit impairment when the entity does not expect to \ncollect all contractual amounts due. The credit loss would not need to be \nconsidered “probable” to be recorded under the proposed Update. For purposes \nof measuring credit impairment, the proposed Update would have required that \nan entity assume that the economic conditions existing at the reporting date \nwould remain unchanged for the remaining life of the financial assets. \nFurthermore, the FASB proposed that interest income should be recognized \nbased on applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis net of \nany allowance for credit losses.  \nBC18. The Board performed extensive outreach to obtain feedback on the May \n2010 Exposure Draft from all stakeholders, including users, preparers, auditors, \nand regulators. Stakeholders provided feedback through public comment letters, \ninvestor questionnaires, field visits with preparers, in-person meetings, and public \nroundtable meetings. More than 2,800 comment letters were received and \nposted on the FASB’s website. Approximately 2,000 of those comment letters \nwere submitted by banking institutions. The Board and staff completed eight field \nvisits with various entities to discuss the operability and the costs and benefits of \nthe Exposure Draft. Field visit participants included banking institutions of various \nsizes, nonfinancial entities, and an insurance company. The Board and staff \nreceived feedback from 120 investors and other users of financial statements \nemployed by more than 60 firms through in-person meetings and calls with \nindividual investors and groups of investors representing a variety of \nperspectives. Users included buy-side analysts employing long-only and long-\nshort strategies, sell-side analysts specializing in either the bank- or insurance-\nrelated sectors, as well as analysts from ratings agencies. The Board and staff \nalso received feedback on the Exposure Draft through 5 public roundtable \nmeetings held with more than 65 participants, including users, preparers, \nregulators, auditors, and others representing various perspectives. \n \n247 \nBC19. Many respondents to the May 2010 Exposure Draft agreed with \nrecording the entire credit loss in the period estimated. Furthermore, superseding \nthe probable threshold for recognizing credit losses was widely supported. Many \ninvestors noted that the probable threshold that had existed for recognizing credit \nlosses prevented financial institutions from recognizing credit losses that were \nimminent in 2007 and 2008. While most stakeholders supported the objective of \na single impairment model, some asserted that the proposed Update retained \nthree different impairment models (that is, one for pools, one for individual \nassets, and one for purchased assets). Additionally, stakeholders expressed \nconcern about the requirement to assume that economic conditions as of the \nreporting date would remain unchanged in the future because it would limit the \ninformation that is considered to past events and current conditions. \nRespondents noted that restricting the ability to include future conditions would \ngenerate significant volatility in the income statement and the amount of reserves \nwould be procyclical (overstated reserves at the trough of a cycle and \nunderstated reserves at the peak of a cycle) and, thus, could have severe, \nunfavorable effects on the overall economy. Finally, stakeholders (including \nusers) opposed the proposal that interest income should be recognized based on \napplying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis net of any \nallowance for credit losses, preferring instead to maintain the approach in current \nGAAP that measures interest income and credit losses separately. Many of those \nrespondents stated that the primary issue is delayed recognition of impairment \nlosses in net income as opposed to the interest recognition model. Respondents \nnoted that the proposed model would decrease transparency to users because \nusers generally want interest income and net interest margin based on the \neffective interest method with credit losses reported separately. Users stated that \nthe proposal would negatively affect their abilities to analyze net interest margin, \na key metric for analysis of a financial institution’s performance. Many users \nstated that the interest income model would make many products look the same \nbased on their reported yields because products that have a high effective \ncontractual interest rate due to credit would reflect a similar net interest margin \nas that of products with a lower rate and little expected credit losses. Therefore, \nusers stated that the current interest income recognition model that reflects an \neffective interest rate based on the contractual terms gives investors an \nindication of the risk characteristics of the underlying asset.  \nBC20. In redeliberating their original impairment proposals, both the Board and \nthe IASB developed a model for impairment accounting that was a variant of their \noriginal proposals. The Board and the IASB sought to achieve a common \nsolution to this important issue and, as a result, in January 2011, the FASB and \nthe IASB jointly issued a Supplementary Document, Accounting for Financial \nInstruments and Revisions to the Accounting for Derivative Instruments and \nHedging Activities—Impairment. This proposal would have eliminated any initial \nrecognition threshold but introduced two different measurement objectives for the \ncredit impairment allowance. For the “good book” (or performing loans), an entity \nwould have recorded the higher of the time-proportionate expected credit loss or \n248 \ncredit losses expected to occur within the foreseeable future. For the “bad book” \n(or nonperforming loans), an entity would have recorded the entire amount of \nexpected credit losses. An asset would have transferred from the good book to \nthe bad book when the collectibility of a financial asset became so uncertain that \nthe entity’s credit risk management objective changed from receiving the regular \npayments from the debtor to recovery of a portion of the financial asset.  \nBC21. The Board received more than 200 comment letters in response to the \nSupplementary Document. Additionally, during the comment letter period for the \nSupplementary Document, the FASB and IASB staff performed extensive \noutreach with preparers, regulators, auditors, users, and other interested parties. \nThe outreach included stakeholders from across various jurisdictions, including \nNorth America (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), Europe, Asia, Oceania, \nand South America. The outreach was in the form of in-person meetings, phone \ncalls, video conferences, and group forums. The outreach program included \ncommentary from more than 1,000 stakeholders, representing more than 100 \ndifferent organizations. \nBC22. Generally, U.S. preparers and auditors supported the development of \nan impairment model that would address the “too little, too late” concern. The \nprocyclicality of reserving also was an overriding concern of those stakeholders. \nFurthermore, they supported moving away from the “probable” threshold that was \nrequired to recognize credit losses. Many respondents to the Supplementary \nDocument indicated that the condition for when to transfer an asset between the \ngood book and bad book needed to be further refined for the proposed \namendments to be operable. Some suggested that a bright line be established to \npromote consistent application. Many preparers and auditors noted that without \nstronger definitions of the important terms, the model would not be operable, \nauditable, or understandable, and comparability would not be achieved. \nAdditionally, respondents said that the concept of “foreseeable future period” was \nvague and could lead to counterintuitive results (such as, the foreseeable future \nbeing shortened during a downturn in the economy, thereby potentially \ndecreasing the credit impairment allowance overall). Finally, many nonfinancial \ninstitutions stated that they do not manage their financial assets in the same way \nas financial institutions and, therefore, they found the good book and bad book \nproposal unfamiliar and inconsistent with their current practices. In addition, U.S. \npreparers understood the objective of linking the pricing of the asset to the \nmeasurement of credit losses but argued that reporting of credit losses in a \nratable fashion would not reflect actual loss experience. Some preparers noted \nthat the greatest exposure to losses exists as the loan is originated and credit \nrisk is reduced over the life of the loan and that the allowance balance should \nfollow a similar pattern. Those stakeholders argued that the objective of linking \nthe pricing of the asset to the measurement of credit loss would not reconcile to \nthe objectives of the “too little, too late” concern.  \nBC23. Leveraging the feedback received from June 2011 through July 2012, \nthe FASB and the IASB jointly developed a “three bucket” impairment model. \n \n249 \nSimilar to the model in the Supplementary Document, the three-bucket model \nwould have eliminated any initial recognition threshold but utilized two different \nmeasurement objectives for the allowance for credit losses, depending on the \nextent of credit deterioration (or recovery) since origination or acquisition. For \nBucket 1, an entity would have recorded an allowance for credit losses equal to \n12 months of expected credit losses (sometimes referred to as “12 months of \nexpected losses”). For Bucket 2 and Bucket 3, an entity would have recorded all \nlifetime expected credit losses. Bucket 2 would have included financial assets \nevaluated collectively. Bucket 3 would have included financial assets evaluated \nindividually. Based on decisions reached through July 2012, an asset would \n“transfer” from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2 (or Bucket 3) when both (a) there has been a \nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality and (b) it is at least \nreasonably possible that some or all of the cash flows may not be collected. \nBC24. While developing application guidance for the three-bucket model, the \nBoard received requests to clarify a number of principles in the model, including \nthe Bucket 1 measurement objective and the “transfer criteria” that trigger a \nchange in the measurement of credit losses. Many stakeholders viewed the \nproposed transfer criteria as reintroducing an incurred loss recognition threshold \nfor a full lifetime loss estimate. From April 2012 through July 2012, the FASB \nstaff and individual Board members held detailed working sessions with \nstakeholders (including users, preparers, auditors, and regulators) to address the \napplication issues through additional clarifying guidance. Despite those efforts, \nstakeholders continued to express significant concerns about whether the three-\nbucket impairment model was operable, auditable, and understandable. The \nmost significant operability concerns related to the use of two different \nmeasurement objectives—a portion of total expected losses for some assets and \na full measurement approach for assets that have exhibited significant \ndeterioration since origination or acquisition. Concerns were raised about (a) the \nambiguity of the criteria for determining which measurement objective to utilize, \n(b) the potential for earnings management relating to the timing of the transfers \nbetween measurement objectives, and (c) the potential “cliff effect” of moving \nfrom an approach that measures a portion of total expected losses for some \nassets to a full measurement approach, and vice versa. Many stated that the \nmodel would result in inconsistent application and would not provide users with \ncomparable or transparent results. Furthermore, users expressed concern about \ninterpreting any model that utilizes two different measurement objectives to arrive \nat the allowance for credit losses recognized on the balance sheet. \nBC25. As a result of the pervasive feedback from U.S. stakeholders about the \nthree-bucket model, in July 2012, the Board decided to revisit some previous \ntentative decisions on the impairment project, primarily relating to the use of two \ndifferent measurement objectives. In doing so, the Board developed the current \nexpected credit loss (CECL) model that retained certain concepts from the jointly \ndeveloped credit loss model that were sound, while at the same time avoiding \nother concepts that U.S. stakeholders considered complex, inoperable, or \n250 \notherwise problematic. The Board exposed this single measurement objective \nmodel for public comment in December 2012 with the issuance of its proposed \nAccounting Standards Update, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Subtopic \n825-15). \nBC26. In March 2013, the IASB issued an Exposure Draft, Financial \nInstruments: Expected Credit Losses. In July 2014, the IASB issued final \nguidance by adding to IFRS 9 the impairment requirements relating to the \naccounting for an entity’s expected credit losses on its financial assets and \ncommitments to extend credit. The impairment requirements retained a dual \nmeasurement based on the level of credit deterioration. \nBC27. The Board received significant input on the December 2012 Exposure \nDraft through comment letters and through direct outreach with numerous \npreparers, auditors, and users of financial statements. Since redeliberations \nbegan in July 2013, the Board received more than 360 comment letters. It also \nobtained feedback through investor meetings with more than 70 analysts and \ninvestors. In addition, the Board conducted 17 field visits with preparers \n(including multinational and domestic, financial and nonfinancial, and public and \nprivate institutions).The Board held various roundtables with preparers, investors, \nand regulators to discuss the Exposure Draft. In addition, outreach was \nperformed with 265 preparers (in the form of comment letters, phone calls, and \nroundtables), of which approximately 60 percent were small banks or credit \nunions. The Board considered the feedback from stakeholders during its \nredeliberations at public meetings held in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. The \namendments in this Update are a result of those redeliberations. \nBC28. The Board observed that investors and other users strongly preferred a \nmodel that records the full amount of expected credit losses (as opposed to \nmaintaining a threshold that must be met before all expected credit losses are \nrecognized or permitting the recognition of only some of the expected credit \nlosses before the threshold is met). Investors stated that they saw no point in \nrecognizing different amounts of expected credit losses on the basis of whether \ndefault events are expected within a specific time frame. They also disagreed \nwith the idea of using any other type of trigger for determining the amount of \nexpected credit losses recognized, which they asserted would add another layer \nof subjectivity into an already subjective estimate. The majority of investors \nagreed that past, current, and reasonable and supportable forecasts should be \nused to develop the estimate. Investors noted that a gross presentation of the \nallowance for purchased assets with credit deterioration would reduce complexity \nand enable better analysis. Investors had mixed views on the application of the \n2012 Exposure Draft to available-for-sale debt securities because some investors \nquestioned whether there was a need for a separate model for reporting credit \nlosses through net income in light of the fact that the market’s view of credit \nalready is reflected in fair value and other comprehensive income for available-\nfor-sale debt securities.  \n \n251 \nBC29. The Board observed that once preparers understood what the Board \nintended with regard to estimating expected credit losses, nearly all preparers \nparticipating in the field visits and outreach sessions indicated that past, current, \nand reasonable and supportable forecasts should be used to develop the loss \nestimate to make the measurement of expected credit losses operable. However, \nmany preparers expressed concern about any requirement to forecast economic \nconditions over the estimated life of the assets in the portfolio. Those preparers \npreferred a model that either measured only some of the expected credit losses \nor maintained a threshold that must be met before all expected credit losses are \nmeasured. Preparers generally disagreed with the approach for available-for-sale \ndebt securities and some preferred to maintain the existing other-than-temporary \nimpairment (OTTI) model for debt securities, while others recommended \nmodifying the practical expedient provided in the December 2012 Exposure \nDraft. \nBC30. The Board received significant feedback from community banks, credit \nunions, and their respective industry groups relating to the potential complexity \nand operability of the proposed Update. To be responsive to the concerns of \nthose preparers, the Board held a public meeting with representatives of \ncommunity banks and credit unions, bank industry groups, regulators, and \nauditors to discuss the concerns about the proposed Update and the expected \ncosts of implementation. The Board responded to the feedback received at that \nmeeting by helping stakeholders understand the requirements of the final Update \nin order to address their concerns. For example, the Board clarified that the \namendments would not require complex modeling and would allow various \nestimation methods. After the meeting, the staff continued to work with certain \ncommunity bank representatives to develop examples that illustrate the \nimplementation of the final Update in a noncomplex environment. \nBC31. The Board also met with the Private Company Council (PCC) to discuss \nits views on applying an expected credit loss model. The PCC requested \nadditional clarification on how an expected credit loss model would apply to trade \nreceivables and how one would measure expected credit losses for certain \nrelated-party loans. Some related-party loans may be viewed as a capital \ncontribution rather than a loan to be repaid. The Board responded to those \nconcerns by providing an illustration to show how the amendments in this Update \nshould be applied to trade receivables and removing from the scope those loans \namong counterparties that are under common control.  \nConsideration of Measurement Attribute on Credit Loss Models \nBC32. The decisions in this Update reached by the Board are consistent with \nthe decisions reached in Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial \nInstruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of \nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities. First, the amendments in Update 2016-\n01 require that equity securities be measured at fair value, with changes in fair \n252 \nvalue included in net income in the period of the change, except for investments \nin consolidated subsidiaries and those that qualify for the equity method of \naccounting. The Board placed weight on the fact that equity securities have no \nmaturity and that the primary way to realize their total value (beyond periodic \ndividends) is through sale. Thus, an entity is not required to record credit losses \nfrom other changes in fair value for these instruments because value ultimately is \nrealized through sale (that is, the entity will not realize value only by collection). \nThe same measurement attribute applies to all trading securities since value is \nexpected through sale, and any credit losses are reflected through changes in \nfair value recorded in earnings. For this reason, financial instruments classified \nas trading and equity securities do not require a separate credit loss model. \nBC33. Second, financial assets recorded at amortized cost, including loans \nand debt securities classified as held to maturity, are recorded at their amortized \ncost basis because under the measurement approach in Accounting Standards \nUpdate 2016-01, an entity represents that the total value of the financial asset is \nexpected to be realized through collection of the amortized cost basis. For these \nassets, changes in fair value from non-credit-related factors do not affect the \ncollection of the amortized cost basis. However, changes due to credit-related \nfactors would affect collection of the amortized cost basis. Therefore, a credit \nloss measurement to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the amount \nexpected to be collected reflects the value expected to be realized for these \nassets. The Board believes that measurement of those assets at the amount \nexpected to be collected, which may be different from fair value, is necessary for \nthese assets because collection of the amortized cost basis is the economic \nphenomena that this measurement attribute is intended to reflect. Additionally, in \ndeveloping the CECL model, the Board considered feedback from users that \npresentation of interest income separate from credit losses provides more \nrelevant information. The Board concluded that the economics of lending are \nfaithfully represented under this approach because entities manage loans on a \ncollective basis where the interest income recognized on good loans over time \noffsets the credit losses of bad loans that are commonly frontloaded. \nBC34. Third, the Board acknowledged that available-for-sale debt securities \nare recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in other \ncomprehensive income because under the measurement approach in Accounting \nStandards Update 2016-01, an entity represents that it may realize the total value \nof the securities either through collection or through sales of the securities. For \nthese assets, a credit loss model is required in order to recognize in earnings any \nchanges in fair value due to credit-related factors because those losses are \nexpected to be realized regardless of whether the entity will realize value through \ncollection or through sale. However, the Board decided that an allowance for \ncredit losses on available-for-sale debt securities should be limited by the amount \nthat fair value is less than amortized cost because an entity can sell its \ninvestment at fair value to avoid realization of credit losses.  \n \n253 \nMeasurement Objective and Initial Recognition Threshold for \nFinancial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost \nBC35. Stakeholders provided extensive feedback on whether the credit loss \nmeasurement for performing assets should differ from the credit loss \nmeasurement for assets that exhibited credit deterioration. Some stakeholders \nstated that the credit losses that an entity anticipated at acquisition or origination \nshould be recorded in a pattern similar to the recognition of the related revenue \n(that is, interest income) on the basis that this compensates the entity for \nundertaking this risk. Those individuals often support a proportionate or time-\nbased approach to recording credit losses or noted that no credit losses should \nbe recorded until credit deterioration has occurred. Others stated that \ninstruments measured using an amortized cost measurement attribute should be \nreflected in the balance sheet at each reporting date at an amount that reflects \nthe present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the \noriginal effective interest rate. They noted that for instruments measured at \namortized cost, it is potentially misleading to investors to allow the balance sheet \nto reflect an amount greater than the amount expected to be collected.  \nBC36. The Board considered, but rejected, various alternatives to the CECL \nmodel when considering the feedback from stakeholders that primarily advocated \nfor the gross-up model and models that were an abbreviated version of the CECL \nmodel. \nBC37. The gross-up model incorporated an approach under which an \nallowance for credit loss estimate would be calculated consistently with the \nrequirements of the CECL model. Supporters of this approach stated that \nrecording the life of loan expected loss as an allowance addresses users’ primary \ncriticism of existing GAAP. It also provides users with the primary information \nthey require, that is, an estimate of the lifetime expected losses of recorded \nassets.  \nBC38. However, an entity would recognize a corresponding amount as a debit \nto the balance sheet that would reflect the expected credit losses that have been \nincluded in the pricing of the financial asset. The entity would amortize that debit \n(as credit loss expense) over time. Alternatively, a model could be developed \nsuch that interest income is not recognized for the gross-up adjustment included \nin the amortized cost basis of the asset. This model would have attempted to \naddress certain Board members’ concerns about the immediate reporting of \nexpected credit losses in net income, concerns that reporting Day-1 expected \ncredit losses does not match the timing of credit losses with the timing of interest \nincome, as well as concerns that the interest rates on financial assets already \nreflect a creditor’s compensation for credit risk.  \nBC39. Abbreviated versions of the CECL model, for example, a truncated \nmodel, under which an allowance would be recorded for credit losses expected \nover a reasonable and supportable period, or for expected credit losses related \n254 \nto assets that have experienced significant credit deterioration, also were \nconsidered in response to preparers’ concerns about measuring expected credit \nlosses over the estimated life of financial assets. However, the Board viewed \nthose alternatives as complex and having shortcomings similar to the incurred \nloss model that has received criticism for being too complex and for reporting \ncredit losses that are too late. The Board decided between these fundamentally \ndifferent alternatives based on five key economic and practical considerations \n(see paragraphs BC40–BC44). \nBC40. First, the Board understands from evidence on historical credit loss \nexperience that credit losses are not realized ratably throughout the life of a loan. \nRather, credit losses often are very low shortly after origination, rise rapidly in the \nearly years of a loan, and then taper to a lower rate until maturity. As a result, the \nBoard concluded that there is a fundamental disconnect between the economics \nof lending (that is, the “lumpy” pattern of actual credit losses) and a time-based \naccounting approach that attempts to link the reporting of credit losses \nanticipated at origination or acquisition with the recognition of interest income. \nAdditionally, under the gross-up model, the Board would have had to determine \nthe timing, period, and methods (accelerated amortization or straight line) to \nrecord the amortization of the gross-up debit. The Board could have decided to \namortize the gross-up debit over the loss emergence period or some other period \nover which the credit deterioration occurred. The Board observed that challenges \nexist when identifying the timing of loss events under an incurred loss model that \nwould be carried forward to a gross-up model. Those challenges resulted in \ndiversity in how a loss event is defined across varying institutions and varying \nloan products. Board members observed that there could be significant \ncomplexity associated with consistently identifying a loss event and, therefore, \nhaving consistent application of the gross-up model. It also was unclear to certain \nBoard members how one would account for changes in the loss emergence \nperiod. For example, it was unclear whether subsequent deterioration would be \nrecognized in the period that expectations changed or whether the subsequent \ndeterioration would be amortized over the remaining life of the asset in a manner \nconsistent with how expected losses identified at origination would be amortized. \nIn addition, it was unclear where the unamortized debit should be reported on the \nbalance sheet. The debit does not meet the definition of an asset and reporting \nthe debit in other comprehensive income has no conceptual foundation.  \nBC41. Second, the Board understands that financial assets are priced (a credit \nspread is established) on the basis of a number of factors, including competitive \nforces in the marketplace, the extent of the existing or desired relationship with \nthe borrower, and the extent of security or collateral. Clearly, a borrower’s \ncreditworthiness is a key factor in pricing the financial asset. Nevertheless, given \nthe multitude of factors that affect pricing, it is impractical (if not impossible) to \nreliably isolate and measure the portion of the credit spread intended to \ncompensate a lender for undertaking the credit risk from the portion of the credit \nspread that results from these other factors (particularly because credit losses \n \n255 \nrarely emerge in a linear fashion and, therefore, the portion of the credit spread \ncompensating the lender for undertaking the credit risk may change over time). \nFurthermore, the Board understands that even the creditworthiness evaluation \nthat influences pricing is based on historical experience for groups of similar \nassets. As a result, while the credit spread charged on the lender’s overall \nportfolio of individual financial assets may be expected to compensate the entity \nfor credit losses for a large portfolio of assets over time, the credit spread on any \nindividual asset is not established in a way that necessarily compensates the \nlender for credit losses on that individual asset. It is the interest income on \nperforming assets that compensates for the credit losses on nonperforming \nassets. As a result, the Board concluded that it is impractical to link accurately \nthe reporting of credit losses anticipated at origination or acquisition with the \ncompensation paid to the lender (interest) for undertaking that risk.  \nBC42. Third, the Board concluded that an entity should present the allowance \nfor credit losses as a contra-asset account to reduce the net amortized cost of \nthe asset to an amount that is expected to be collected. When the Board \nconsidered truncated models or other models that limited the measurement of \ncredit losses to a specific time period, it observed that the allowance for credit \nlosses would not represent a complete estimate of an entity’s expectations. \nAdditionally, if the measurement objective is based on a trigger for recording \nexpected credit losses, an added layer of subjectivity and complexity would be \nadded when identifying the assets that met a particular trigger. As a result of \nthose operability concerns for financial assets, the net amortized cost basis (net \nof allowance) would be measured at an amount greater than the amount \nexpected to be collected. The Board concluded that the amendments in this \nUpdate are more aligned with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of \nFinancial Statements, which states that “a separate item that reduces or \nincreases the carrying amount of an asset is sometimes found in financial \nstatements. For example, an estimate of uncollectible amounts reduces \nreceivables to the amount expected to be collected. . . . Those ‘valuation \naccounts’ are part of the related assets and are neither assets in their own right \nnor liabilities” (paragraph 34). The guidance in this Update relates to the \nmeasurement (rather than recognition of an asset or liability in its own right) on \nthe basis that Concepts Statement 6 highlights that the valuation accounts are \npart of the related assets and liabilities. The Board concluded that it is misleading \nto investors to allow the balance sheet to reflect an amount greater than the \namount expected to be collected for instruments measured using amortized cost, \nwhich would be the result of an approach that records only incurred losses or \nsome other threshold for recording a portion of the expected credit losses. The \namortized cost basis of an asset (which excludes the allowance for credit losses) \ngenerally reflects the present value of contractual cash flows, discounted at the \noriginal effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the best rate for \nrecognizing interest income because the effective interest rate provides decision-\nuseful information about the level of credit risk a lender took on when it originated \nor purchased a financial asset. Throughout this project investors supported this \n256 \nview, and a primary reason for their preference is to have interest income and \ncredit losses measured separately. As a result, the Board concluded that it is \nmore decision useful to present the net carrying amount on the balance sheet for \nthe amount expected to be collected. The Board determined that the accounting \nof credit losses is not a recognition principle, it is a measurement principle. What \nis recognized are the financial assets on the balance sheet. Those recognized \nfinancial assets should then be measured for credit losses, which fundamentally \nalso should occur in the period in which the assets are recognized.  \nBC43. Fourth, the Board compared the CECL model with other models under \nvarious hypothetical economic scenarios while also considering the varying \neffects of increasing, decreasing, and stable loan growth. The Board observed \nthat there are three ways to record expected credit losses: up-front, over time, or \nwhen the loss is realized. The Board noted that under all considered models, the \namount of credit loss reported in the income statement over the life of the \nfinancial asset is ultimately the same. In addition, the various models resulted in \ncomparable income statement amounts in periods of stable loan growth. The \nmodels that limited losses to a reasonable or supportable truncated period or \nuntil significant deterioration occurred had an effect of showing a sharp increase \nin losses later in the assets’ economic lives. The Board observed that models \nthat limited losses would not address the concerns relating to models that could \nresult in procyclical outcomes, as highlighted in paragraph BC17 of the May 2010 \nExposure Draft. \nBC44. Fifth, the Board decided to measure expected losses using a single \nmeasurement objective to facilitate users’ abilities to understand and compare \nestimated expected credit losses within and across entities over time. Alternative \nmodels that measure expected losses on the basis of credit deterioration or \ntruncated reasonable and supportable periods result in variations in the total \nallowance for credit losses that make it challenging for users to analyze and \nunderstand the factors causing changes in expected credit losses across entities \nand over time.  \nBC45. As a result, the Board decided that at each reporting date, the net \namortized cost balance in an entity’s balance sheet should reflect the amount \nexpected to be collected. The Board decided not to record only a portion of total \nexpected credit losses because the resulting net amortized cost would not reflect \nthe amount expected to be collected. Rather, that net amortized cost would \ninclude some amounts that are not expected to be collected. Furthermore, the \nBoard concluded that concerns about the reliability of the estimate as a result of \nthe potential uncertainty of the timing of the losses should not be the primary \ndriver of whether the credit losses should be recorded. \nBC46. The Board concluded that the measurement of credit losses should be \nbased on an entity’s expectations about the collectibility of financial assets held \nat the reporting date. Even though an entity must estimate credit losses over the \nentire contractual term of the financial assets (recognizing that expected \n \n257 \nprepayments affect the estimated life), the Board decided not to characterize \nexpected credit losses as “lifetime” expected credit losses. The use of the term \nlifetime is interpreted in many different ways and may lead some to believe that \nan entity must identify the exact amount and timing of uncollectible cash flows in \neach year of the asset’s life for use in a discounted cash flow technique to \nestimate expected credit losses. For others, the term lifetime suggests the \nmeasurement of a stress-case (or worst-case) credit loss scenario after a default \nhas occurred. Also, the term lifetime may lead some to believe that estimating \nexpected credit losses must be done on an individual asset basis rather than \nhaving the ability to estimate expected credit losses on a collective (pool) basis.  \nBC47. The Board concluded that an entity’s expectations about the collectibility \nof a financial asset should consider available information about past events, \nincluding historical loss experience with similar assets, current conditions, and \nreasonable and supportable forecasts that inform the entity about the estimated \ncollectibility of the asset. In considering past events, an entity should consider \nchanges in financial asset underwriting practices, including their effects on the \nassessments of business plans and strategies. In considering current conditions \nand forecasts about the future, an entity should consider both the economic \nenvironment and the forecasted direction of the economic environment because \nthat best reflects the economic environment facing the borrower as of the \nreporting date. The Board also included forecasts about the future to respond to \nfeedback on the 2010 proposed Update, which would have required locking in \nestimates as of the balance sheet date. Preparers indicated that ignoring \nreasonable, supportable forecasts would have resulted in a misleading expected \nloss estimate.  \nBC48. The Board considered retaining an initial recognition threshold (such as \nprobable) for recording credit losses. The Board concluded, however, that the \nmodel for recording credit losses should not be based on a notion of “incurred” \nlosses because it would interfere with the timely measurement of changes in \nexpected credit losses and the reporting of credit losses. Similarly, an entity \nshould not automatically conclude that there are no expected credit losses simply \nbecause all of the amounts due have been received to date. The amendments in \nthis Update would differ from an incurred loss model because measurement of \ncredit losses would not be based on a specific triggering event or threshold. \nRemoving the probable threshold would result in a more timely measurement of \nexpected credit losses because losses can be expected before they are probable \n(as that term is used in Topic 450) of occurring (or have occurred). The Board \nconcluded that the relevance of balance sheet amounts that reflect expected \ncollectibility without consideration of a recognition threshold outweighs potential \nconcerns about the subjective nature of the estimate. Furthermore, eliminating \nthe probable threshold would be consistent with the Board’s decisions in FASB \nStaff Position (FSP) FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of \nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments, issued in April 2009, which modified the \nimpairment guidance for debt securities. One of the changes made by that FSP \n258 \nwas to remove the probable threshold for assessing whether a debt security is \nother-than-temporarily impaired. The Board made that change to clarify that an \nentity should not wait for an event of default or other actual shortfall of cash flows \nto conclude that a credit impairment exists.  \nBC49. If observers of the Board’s approach focus on individual assets rather \nthan groups of similar assets, they might incorrectly interpret the Board’s \napproach as recording losses prematurely and in noneconomic amounts. \nHowever, financial institutions manage many financial assets on a collective \nbasis, wherein new financial assets are originated, existing financial assets are \npaid down, and some financial assets may be purchased and some financial \nassets may be sold. In addition, many users analyze financial asset portfolios of \nfinancial institutions on a collective basis. The estimate of credit losses under this \nUpdate is based on the current assessment of credit risk of the assets on a \ncollective basis and the entity’s loss experience (and expectation) with assets of \nsimilar risk characteristics. For example, if a group of similar assets is fully \nperforming at the end of a reporting period, the entity’s experience might reflect \nthat it typically suffers minimal losses. Conversely, if a group of similar assets \nexhibits increased credit risk, the entity’s experience might suggest that it \ntypically suffers more significant losses. Credit losses for assets without similar \nrisk characteristics would be measured individually. Each period, the entity would \nreassess the credit risk and expected performance of its assets and revise its \nestimate of expected losses accordingly. Because there is no “trigger” for \nrecognition, the method should reflect changes in the status of the assets, as well \nas changes in the entity’s experience and expectations in a timely manner, and \nthe allowance should be commensurate with the expected losses inherent in the \nassets held at the reporting date.  \nMeasurement of Expected Credit Losses for Financial Assets \nMeasured at Amortized Cost \nBC50. The Board acknowledges that any approach to estimating the \ncollectibility of financial assets is subjective. The Board has permitted entities to \nestimate expected credit losses using various methods because the Board \nbelieves entities manage credit risk differently and should have flexibility to best \nreport their expectations. The Board recognizes that different methods may result \nin a range of acceptable outcomes. Given the subjective nature of this estimate \nand certain fact patterns, one methodology’s consideration of time value may \nhave a more direct impact on the estimate of expected credit losses than other \nmethods. Some entities may be able to forecast over the entire estimated life of \nan asset, while other entities may forecast over a shorter period. The complexity \nof the portfolio, size of the entity, access to information, and management of the \nportfolio may result in approaches with varying degrees of sophistication. \nBecause entities may have different levels of sophistication, the Board did not \nprescribe one type of methodology for measuring expected credit losses for \n \n259 \nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost. The Board concluded that different \noutcomes for expected credit losses due to these and other factors are \nacceptable under the amendments in this Update. Furthermore, using terms such \nas reasonable and supportable does not imply a single conclusion or \nmethodology upon which an entity must base its estimate. Different parties using \ndifferent methodologies do not make a particular estimate unreasonable. While \nthe range of reasonable outcomes is not unlimited, the Board concluded that it is \nrare that there will only be one acceptable choice in estimating credit losses. \nEstimates of credit losses may not precisely predict actual future events and, \ntherefore, subsequent events may not be indicative of the reasonableness of \nthose estimates. \nBC51. The Board also concluded that investors understand the subjective \nnature of credit loss estimates. The amendments in this Update require that an \nentity base its estimate on relevant information about past events, including \nhistorical loss experience with similar assets, current conditions, and reasonable \nand supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectibility of the reported \namount of financial assets. In doing so, the Board expects that an entity should \nnot ignore relevant data when considering historical experience or when \nconsidering qualitative adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and \nsupportable forecasts. However, an entity should not default to using only the \nmost observable external data if its internal data are sufficient. An entity must use \njudgment in considering the relative effect of conflicting forecasts about the future \nand their implications for expected credit losses. The Board expects that the \nadjustment for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts will \nbe the most subjective aspect of the estimate and, therefore, decided to require \nin paragraph 326-20-50-11 specific disclosure about those factors. The Board \nconcluded that removing any recognition trigger of the expected loss estimate \nremoves a significant element of discretion from GAAP and from alternatives \npreviously considered. That is, because the measurement objective is the same \nevery period, there is no need to identify when an asset has deteriorated enough \nto warrant full measurement of expected credit losses. \nBC52. The Board also acknowledges that estimating expected credit losses \nover longer periods of time (such as the contractual term of financial assets) \nrequires a significant amount of judgment, especially when using discounted \ncash flow techniques. Although an entity must estimate credit losses over the \nentire contractual term of the financial assets (considering the effect of \nprepayments), the Board recognizes that as the forecast horizon increases, the \ndegree of judgment involved in estimating expected credit losses also increases \nbecause the availability of detailed inputs to estimates for periods in the future \ndecreases. An entity should not ignore available information that is relevant to \nthe estimated collectibility of the reported amount. \nBC53. The Board concluded that it is not decision useful to assign a credit loss \nestimate of zero to certain periods merely because an entity is unable to \nprecisely estimate future economic conditions for those periods. Rather, historical \n260 \ninformation about losses is a relevant metric upon which to base an entity’s \ncurrent estimate of credit losses for those periods beyond which the entity \nbelieves it is able to develop or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts. \nFurthermore, an approach that does not record some expected losses (for \nexample, those that are expected to occur after some prescribed forecast period) \nwould fail to reflect the amount that an entity expects to collect, which is the \nBoard’s measurement objective for financial assets. Additionally, that approach \nwould introduce noncomparability in expected credit losses across instrument \ntypes, time periods, and entities. Therefore, the Board decided to provide \nadditional guidance on how to measure expected credit losses as an entity \nmoves into periods of increasing uncertainty and decreasing precision. The \nreversion to an entity’s historical loss information emphasizes the relevance of \nknown losses that have occurred in the past on similar financial instruments and \naddresses preparer’s concerns about the reliability of measuring those credit \nlosses in periods of declining precision. Stakeholders informed the Board that \nsome entities will use this reversion technique, while others may have the \nsystems and processes in place to forecast over the estimated life of the financial \nasset on a reasonable and supportable basis.  \nBC54. The Board considered including specific guidance that would have \nprescribed when credit losses should be estimated on an individual asset basis \n(such as a triggering event) or on a collective (or pool) basis. The Board decided \nnot to specify the unit of measurement or require certain methods to be followed \nin specific circumstances. Instead, the Board decided to provide a consistent set \nof measurement principles that could be implemented for both individual assets \nand groups of similar assets, understanding that estimation techniques might \ndiffer.  \nUse of Amortized Cost When Estimating Credit Losses \nBC55. Concepts Statement 6 highlights that a valuation account, such as the \nallowance for credit losses, must not be viewed as independent from the related \nasset or liability. The Board concluded that the underlying assets are what should \nbe measured when estimating credit losses, rather than attempting to measure a \nvaluation account that is separate and distinct from the asset to which the \nvaluation account relates. Therefore, a financial asset’s amortized cost net of the \nallowance for credit losses represents the amount of amortized cost expected to \nbe collected.  \nBC56. Financial information for financial assets measured at amortized cost is \npresented on an amortized cost basis. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to \nbase the estimate of expected credit losses solely on the unpaid principal \nbalance when amortized cost amounts reported on the balance sheet may differ \nbecause of items such as deferred fees or costs, premium, or discount.  \n \n261 \nBC57. The Board also considered current practice for financial assets \nmeasured at amortized cost and observed that while diversity exists, current \npractice generally records writeoffs of amortized cost (including net deferred fees \nor costs, premium, or discount) through the allowance for credit losses. \nTherefore, historical data that are used as a basis for estimating credit losses \nfrequently would already incorporate writeoffs of these components of amortized \ncost. \nBC58. As a result, the Board decided that the allowance for credit losses \nshould be estimated and presented such that amortized cost net of the allowance \nfor credit losses represents the amount of amortized cost expected to be \ncollected. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to limit the estimate of the \nallowance for credit losses by only considering the unpaid principal balance \nbecause that may not be the amount recognized for the financial assets.  \nBC59. Consistent with the Board’s intent not to prescribe specific methods or \napproaches and to facilitate the operability of the amendments in this Update \nwhere possible, the amendments allow entities to develop their estimate of \nexpected credit loss on the amortized cost basis in two steps: by first estimating \nthe expected credit losses on the unpaid principal balances, then by adjusting \nthat estimated credit loss for the impact of other elements of the amortized cost \nbasis not expected to be collected (including net deferred fees or costs, premium, \nor discount). Such an approach may help entities leverage historical loss \ninformation based on unpaid principal balances.  \nBC60. The Board considered how the use of amortized cost basis may affect \nfinancial assets recorded with a premium; for example, if a loan was recorded at \n$102 upon origination and the entity expected a credit loss of $2 at maturity, \nwhether the allowance would require a full write-down of the premium upon \norigination. That approach would be an inappropriate application of the \namendments in this Update because amortized cost inherently considers both \nthe timing and amount of the expected credit loss. For example, if a principal loss \nwas expected at the maturity date, the premium would be fully amortized at that \ntime and no allowance would be necessary for the premium upon origination. \nThe loss rate would reflect the expected loss of the amortized cost basis in the \nnumerator, and implicitly consider the timing of future amortization of premiums \nand discounts. Separately, use of amortized cost also can be reflected in a loss-\nrate approach that has a par amount in the denominator as long as that loss rate \nis then applied against the par amount of the financial asset. There are two key \nconsiderations. First, the numerator should consider the expected credit loss of \nthe amortized cost basis of the financial asset. Second, the basis in the \ndenominator (amortized cost or par amount) and the basis of the financial asset \nto which the loss rate is applied (amortized cost or par amount) are the same.  \nBC61. The Board observed that upon origination the amortized cost basis of a \nfinancial asset is equal to principal and interest cash flows discounted at the \noriginal effective interest rate. As a result, the amortized cost amount implicitly \n262 \nreflects the time value of money. The amendments in this Update do not require \nthat a discounted cash flow model be used that explicitly considers the time value \nof money. An entity should have the flexibility to utilize estimation techniques that \nare practical and relevant to its circumstance. For example, an entity may \ndevelop loss statistics on the basis of the amortized cost amount written off and \nuse those loss statistics to estimate the portion of the recorded amortized cost \nbasis that is not expected to be recovered because of credit loss. Methods that \nindirectly consider the time value of money may include loss-rate methods, roll-\nrate methods, probability-of-default methods, and an aging schedule using loss \nfactors. Although there may be a range of acceptable outcomes between the \nvarious models based on assumptions utilized, the Board decided that methods \nusing amortized cost information are acceptable because the amortized cost \nbasis of a financial asset implicitly reflects the time value of money.  \nBC62. Consistent with the basis for conclusions in FASB Statement No. 114, \nAccounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, the Board concluded that a \nfinancial asset’s effective interest rate should be the rate used to discount \nexpected cash flows when expected credit losses are estimated using a \ndiscounted cash flow method. The Board also concluded that the credit loss \nmeasurement should reflect only expected credit losses. The Board decided that \nthe credit loss measurement should not reflect changes in market rates of \ninterest, because that would fundamentally change the measurement method \nfrom amortized cost. The Board observed that the amortized cost basis of a \nfinancial asset is the present value of the contractual future cash inflows—both \nthose designated as principal and those as interest—discounted at the financial \ninstrument’s effective interest rate. Thus, the measurement basis for credit losses \nwill be the same as the measurement basis for the amortized cost basis of the \nsame financial asset. \nApproach to Estimating Credit Losses for Financial Assets \nMeasured at Amortized Cost \nBC63. The Board decided that an entity should consider the expected risk of \nloss, even if that risk is remote, and that an entity need not measure an expected \ncredit loss when historical information adjusted for current conditions and \nreasonable and supportable forecasts results in an expectation that the risk of \nnonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero. The Board decided not to \nexplicitly state which financial assets are appropriate to have a zero allowance \nfor expected credit losses. The Board understands that an expectation of zero \nloss is entirely based on the nature and characteristics of a financial asset, which \nmay change over time. As a result, the Board concluded that a “bright-line” \napproach would be inappropriate for all facts and circumstances and decided not \nto provide explicit guidance on what specific assets are appropriate for zero \nexpected credit losses. The Board decided that an entity should determine at the \n \n263 \nreporting date an estimate of credit loss that best reflects its expectations (or its \nbest estimate of expected credit loss). \nBC64. The Board decided that measurement approaches for collateral-\ndependent financial assets (assets whose collection is substantially from the sale \nor operation of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial \ndifficulty) in which expected credit losses are estimated by comparing the \namortized cost basis with the fair value of collateral are acceptable practical \nexpedients for estimating expected credit losses because fair value reflects the \namount expected to be collected.    \nBC65. The Board also understands that to some stakeholders, the collateral-\ndependent practical expedient should be based on liquidation value rather than \nfair value. However, the Board decided to retain the fair value measurement \nconcept because fair value is well understood and applied in current practice. \nThe Board concluded that an additional measurement method of liquidation value \nwould add complexity. In addition, in many situations the fair value of collateral is \nnot significantly different from the amount that the entity would receive upon the \nsale of the collateral, even in situations in which the collateral is a foreclosed \nproperty. The Board concluded that when measuring fair value, an entity should \nconsider the characteristics that a market participant would take into account \nwhen valuing the asset. Therefore, in the case of foreclosed property, the fair \nvalue should reflect the fact that it is a foreclosed property. As a result, the fair \nvalue of a foreclosed property may not be significantly different from the \nestimated cash an entity would collect upon the sale of the foreclosed property.  \nCollective Evaluation When Similar Risk Characteristics Exist for \nFinancial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost \nBC66. The Board understands that many entities measure credit losses on \nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost by aggregating assets with similar \nrisk characteristics. Therefore, the Board anchored its analysis on the expected \nlosses for groups of similar financial assets rather than a particular financial asset \nheld by the entity. \nBC67. The December 2012 Exposure Draft would have required an estimate of \nexpected credit losses to consider multiple outcomes. That is, when developing \nan estimate of expected credit losses, the estimate would have always had to \nreflect both the possibility that a credit loss results and the possibly that no credit \nloss results. The Board initially favored this approach because it believed that \nindividual financial assets generally are priced assuming an estimated likelihood \nof credit losses on similar assets, although the entity initially expected to collect \nall contractual cash flows on each individual asset. Accordingly, the December \n2012 Exposure Draft would have prohibited an entity from determining the \nestimate of expected credit losses solely on the basis of the statistical mode, or \n264 \nmost likely outcome. Therefore, the use of a “mean” for each asset was viewed \nto be a better predictor of actual results for the entity. \nBC68. The Board received feedback that a requirement to use multiple \noutcomes would lead to the measurement of an expected credit loss on financial \nassets, even though there may be no expectation of a credit loss because of \ncollateral protection or other credit enhancements. The Board also heard that the \nmultiple outcome approach could be interpreted as requiring complex modeling \ntechniques. The Board considered this feedback and decided to replace the \nrequirement to consider multiple outcomes with a requirement to estimate losses \non a collective basis if similar risk characteristics exist. \nBC69. The Board concluded that financial assets generally are priced \nassuming an estimated likelihood of credit losses on similar assets, although an \nentity initially expects to collect all of the contractual cash flows on each \nindividual asset. Similarly, while an entity might not currently expect a loss on an \nindividual asset, it ordinarily would expect some level of losses in a group of \nassets with similar risk characteristics. Therefore, an estimate of expected credit \nlosses should reflect a collective assessment if similar risk characteristics exist \nfor assets measured at amortized cost. Credit losses on those assets should be \nmeasured individually if similar risk characteristics do not exist for assets \nmeasured at amortized cost.  \nBC70. The Board also concluded that an entity should utilize estimation \ntechniques that are practical and relevant to its circumstance, if the techniques \nare consistent with the principles for measuring expected credit losses. The \nBoard acknowledges that some measurement methods (such as a loss-rate \nmethod, a roll-rate method, a probability-of-default method, and an aging \nschedule) rely on an extensive population of actual loss data as an input when \nestimating credit losses. Therefore, these inherently reflect collective evaluation \nin a manner consistent with the principle because the population of actual loss \ndata is considered on a collective basis, even when the loss rates are applied to \nindividual assets. \nBC71. During the redeliberations of the December 2012 Exposure Draft, the \nBoard noted that it would be inappropriate to measure credit losses for financial \nassets on an individual basis to arrive at a zero expected credit loss when a pool \nof financial assets with similar risk characteristics exists that would indicate \notherwise. Separately, if pools of financial assets were redefined to create certain \npools that have similar risk characteristics but demonstrate that while there is risk \nof loss, nonpayment of the amortized cost basis would be zero, the Board would \nexpect the entity to remeasure the loss information for the remaining pools. An \nadjustment should be made because their expectation of credit loss may have \nchanged as a result of the change in the composition of the new pool(s). \n \n265 \nUse of a Valuation Allowance for Expected Credit Losses for \nFinancial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost \nBC72. The Board decided that expected credit losses for all financial assets \nshould be reflected through a valuation allowance rather than a direct adjustment \nto the cost basis of the asset. However, the Board also decided that an entity \nshould write off a financial asset (or portion of a financial asset) when the entity \ndetermines that it is uncollectible.  \nBC73. The Board retained the requirements to write off assets if they are \ndeemed uncollectible. The December 2012 Exposure Draft proposed that the \nassets be written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The \nBoard received feedback that writing off an asset when there is no reasonable \nexpectation of recovery could be considered to be a significant delay from the \npoint when an asset is deemed uncollectible. This concern was due in part to \nregulatory guidance that stated that the designation as an uncollectible asset \ndoes not mean that it has no recovery or salvage value. The Board did not intend \nto delay the point at which assets are written off and, therefore, decided to retain \nthe requirement that assets are written off if they are deemed to be uncollectible. \nBC74. Previous impairment guidance for loans that existed before the issuance \nof this Update required the recognition of an allowance (a contra-asset) and \npermitted an entity to reverse a previously recognized allowance if there is an \nupward change in expectations about the collection of future cash flows. In \ncontrast, previous impairment guidance for debt securities required impairment to \nbe recorded as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security if an \nentity identified an other-than-temporary impairment. Any subsequent increases \nin the amount expected to be collected would be reflected in net income on a \nprospective basis as interest income through an adjustment of the effective \ninterest rate. The requirement to adjust the effective interest rate on a \nprospective basis sometimes resulted in an unusually high effective rate if a large \ncredit impairment was recorded and there were significant subsequent increases \nin expectations about the collection of cash flows.  \nBC75. Some stakeholders expressed concerns that the requirement to adjust \nthe amortized cost basis of a security when an entity recorded an other-than-\ntemporary impairment distorted yields because those amounts are recognized as \ninterest income in future periods. As a result, the Board decided that expected \ncredit losses should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses for all \nfinancial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and the \nallowance (as opposed to the yield) should be adjusted if credit loss expectations \nsubsequently improve. This decision was supported by both preparers and users. \nPreparers often cited the complexity of continually adjusting the yield on those \nsecurities on a prospective basis. Users preferred the reversal of credit losses to \nbe reflected in the allowance account and not in interest income because this \n266 \neffect distorted yields significantly, was not transparent, and inhibited the ability \nto compare interest incomes of similar financial institutions.  \nMeasurement of Credit Losses for Available-for-Sale Debt \nSecurities \nBC76. The December 2012 Exposure Draft proposed that available-for-sale \ndebt securities utilize the same credit loss measurement model as financial \nassets that are measured at amortized cost. However, the Board recognized that \nexpected credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities may be measured \nmore frequently on an individual asset basis because the business model \ninvolves selling individual assets. Therefore, in an effort to minimize the cost of \ncompliance when expected credit losses are insignificant, the December 2012 \nExposure Draft stated that if an entity meets two conditions, then it may apply the \npractical expedient and would not be required to apply the model to the available-\nfor-sale debt security being evaluated. The two conditions were (a) the fair value \nof the financial asset is greater than or equal to its amortized cost basis and (b) \ncredit losses on the financial asset are expected to be insignificant.  \nBC77. Respondents acknowledged the Board’s intent to develop a single \nimpairment model for all financial assets. However, some respondents stated \nthat the OTTI model is well understood by investors and is applied consistently \nby preparers. Some suggested that applying the credit losses model in the \nproposed Update would result in less decision-useful information as compared \nwith the information resulting from applying the OTTI model. They noted that the \nOTTI model was an improvement in light of the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 \nby removing the probability threshold and that users benefited from having more \ntimely insight into the recognition of credit losses for securities. In addition, they \nmentioned that having a different impairment model for debt securities is justified \nbecause available-for-sale debt securities are managed differently than other \nfinancial assets are managed. Users also expressed a mixed reaction to the \napproach for available-for-sale debt securities. Users were less concerned about \nwhen impairment is recorded in the income statement because the primary \nmeasurement of available-for-sale debt securities is fair value. \nBC78. In response to feedback on the December 2012 Exposure Draft, the \nBoard considered a CECL fair value floor model for available-for-sale debt \nsecurities for which the expected credit losses would be measured under the \nCECL model with certain modifications. Under a CECL fair value floor model, an \nentity would not recognize expected credit losses if the financial asset’s fair value \nequals or exceeds its amortized cost basis. Additionally, if the financial asset’s \nfair value is less than its amortized cost basis, an entity would recognize \nexpected credit losses in net income determined under the CECL model but the \nallowance for credit losses would be limited to the difference between the \nfinancial asset’s fair value and its amortized cost basis. \n \n267 \nBC79. The Board received feedback on this model through outreach calls and \nroundtables with various stakeholders. They highlighted a desire to retain the \nOTTI model and expressed concerns about complexity that would arise with a \nCECL fair value floor model. The Board acknowledged that fair value changes \noccur not only because of changes in expected credit losses but also because of \nnon-credit-related factors, such as changes in liquidity in the market, general \nmarket volatility, industry-specific volatility, and changes due to interest rate \nmovements. The CECL fair value floor model would have depended on many of \nthose variables in the market place. Therefore, given the construct of the fair \nvalue model, expected credit losses could have been recorded when changes in \nnon-credit-related factors occur in the market. For example, under a CECL fair \nvalue floor model, when fair value drops below cost because of changes in \ninterest rates (or other variables mentioned above), the model would have \nrequired the recognition of expected credit losses and, therefore, changes in \ninterest rates could have been a primary driver in the initial recognition as well as \nmeasurement of expected credit losses. \nBC80. The Board also was concerned with the application of the CECL model \nwith a fair value floor to available-for-sale debt securities because under the \nmeasurement approach in Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, an entity \nrepresents these securities are not held solely for the collection of contractual \ncash flows. The Board acknowledged that the CECL model is designed to \nmeasure expected credit losses over the contractual life of the asset and \nquestioned whether it would be appropriate to include available-for-sale debt \nsecurities in that measurement if they are not similar to other assets that are \nintended to be held to maturity, such as loans not held for sale or held-to-maturity \ndebt securities. \nBC81. As a result of the feedback on the December 2012 Exposure Draft, as \nwell as feedback on an alternative CECL fair value floor model, the Board \nacknowledged that the available-for-sale credit loss model within the final Update \nis similar to the CECL model because they both require lifetime losses to be \nreflected in earnings; however, the same credit loss model cannot apply because \nthere are different measurement attributes. The measurement attribute for \navailable-for-sale debt securities necessitates a separate credit loss model \nbecause an entity may realize the total value of the securities either through \ncollection of contractual cash flows or through sales of the securities. \nFurthermore, the unit of account for these assets is defined as an individual \nsecurity, which means collective evaluation is not an acceptable approach for \ndetermining credit losses. Lastly, the amount of credit losses that will be realized \nfor these assets is limited to the amount that fair value is less than amortized cost \nbecause an entity can sell its investment at fair value to avoid realization of credit \nlosses. The Board considered these factors in their decisions on the available-\nfor-sale debt security credit loss model as described in paragraphs BC82 and \nBC83. \n268 \nBC82. The Board decided to make targeted improvements to the impairment \nguidance for available-for-sale debt securities. Specifically, an allowance \napproach should be used for measuring credit losses when there is not an intent \nor more-likely-than-not requirement to sell, which will allow an entity to record \nreversals of credit losses in current-period net income. The measurement of \ncredit losses will be similar to current GAAP; however, the measurement of credit \nlosses will be reported as an allowance rather than a write-down of the amortized \ncost basis. Additionally, the Board decided to prohibit an entity from avoiding the \nrecording of credit losses by considering the length of time that the fair value of \nan available-for-sale debt security has been less than its amortized cost basis. \nFinally, in determining whether a credit loss exists, an entity no longer should \nconsider the historical and implied volatility and recoveries or additional declines \nin the fair value after the balance sheet date of an available-for-sale debt \nsecurity. \nBC83. In subsequent redeliberations, the Board reconsidered adding a fair \nvalue floor to the amended model. The Board decided that consistent with the \nobjectives of an available-for-sale security, an entity could look to limit its credit \nloss exposure by selling a security if the total fair value loss was less than the \ncredit loss measured for the security. That outcome could occur if a portion of the \nfair value attributable to non-credit-related factors offset the portion of fair value \nattributable to credit factors. Given the importance of fair value in the \nmeasurement of available-for-sale securities, the Board decided to incorporate a \nfair value floor in the amended model.  \nPurchased Financial Assets with Credit Deterioration \nBC84. Investors and preparers generally supported the gross-up model for \npurchased financial assets with credit deterioration. Stakeholders expressed \nconcerns about the complexity of applying and interpreting the existing model for \npurchased credit impaired financial assets in Subtopic 310-30 as follows:  \na. Investors and preparers expressed concern about the asymmetrical \ntreatment of favorable and unfavorable changes in expected cash flows \nthat existed in Subtopic 310-30.  \nb. Investors expressed concern about interpreting the markedly different \napproach for estimating credit losses for purchased financial assets with \ncredit deterioration and other assets under existing guidance.  \nc. Preparers expressed concern about the cost and complexity of applying \nthe model that practically required a “closed pool” calculation \nmethodology (that is, the assets must be segregated and tracked as a \ngroup), as well as concerns about the scope of what constitutes a \npurchased financial asset with credit deterioration. \nd. Generally, stakeholders expressed concern about:  \n1. The lack of comparability between impaired loans acquired in a \nbusiness combination and impaired loans originated by the entity, \n \n269 \nespecially in regards to differences in the amount of allowance for \ncredit losses recorded for similar assets \n2. The requirement to adjust the accretable yield and recognize \nimprovements prospectively was considered to be complex and \ndifficult to implement. \nBC85. The Board concluded that purchased assets and originated assets \nshould follow the same model, to the extent possible. At the same time, \nrecognizing interest revenue on the basis of contractual cash flows for all \npurchased assets could result in situations in which an entity accretes to an \namount that it does not expect to collect, which would result in artificially inflated \nyields. For this reason, the Board concluded that when recognizing interest \nincome on certain assets, it is inappropriate to accrete from the purchase price to \nthe contractual cash flows. Specifically, when a purchased asset has deteriorated \nmore than insignificantly since origination, it is more decision useful to exclude \nthe credit discount from the amount accreted to interest income. As a result, the \ndiscount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to credit losses at \nthe date of acquisition of a purchased financial asset with credit deterioration \nshould not be recognized as interest income.  \nBC86. The Board decided that the allowance for purchased assets with more-\nthan-insignificant credit deterioration since origination should be added to the \npurchase price upon recognition of those assets (commonly referred to as the \ngross-up approach). Recording the amortized cost as the sum of the allowance \nand the purchase price enhances comparability and prevents the accretion of the \ncredit discount into interest income. The Board favors this approach because \nchanges in the allowance for credit losses for all assets, including purchased \nfinancial assets with credit deterioration, will be reflected in net income in the \nperiod of change. The Board understands that those decisions will allow \npreparers to utilize the same tools and methodology for estimating credit losses \nfor purchased financial assets both with credit deterioration and without credit \ndeterioration. \nBC87. Stakeholders, particularly users, supported the approach for purchased \nfinancial assets with credit deterioration. Other stakeholders, including some \nusers, also supported measuring all purchased assets under the gross-up model. \nIn more limited situations, certain stakeholders also supported carrying forward \nthe allowance for credit losses from an acquired institution, which was prohibited \nby paragraph 805-20-30-4. However, there was diversity in views among user \ncommunities because other users supported one of the main objectives of the \nproject, which was to employ a single measurement objective. Those users \nsupported the accounting for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration \nbut only on a consistent basis; they did not want to only extend the model to \ncertain fact patterns on an exception basis, such as business combinations.  \nBC88. For purposes of measuring expected credit losses, the Board concluded \nthat there is no inherent difference between assets acquired in a business \n270 \ncombination and those that are purchased outside a business combination. The \nBoard decided not to extend the gross-up approach to all purchased assets \nbecause (a) the credit risk may be difficult to reliably isolate from other discounts \nreflected in the purchase price when it is insignificant, (b) the benefits would not \njustify the incremental costs associated with a requirement to separate the credit \nand noncredit discounts when the amounts are insignificant, and (c) the accretion \nof the discount into income due to credit would be insignificant. The Board \nstruggled with applying a gross-up method for financial assets purchased at or \nnear par when there generally has not been a more-than-insignificant increase in \ncredit risk because those assets should apply the same model as originated \nfinancial assets. The Board felt it had to draw a line and placed weight on user \nfeedback stating that increased comparability is achieved by grossing up the \nallowance when there has been a more-than-insignificant increase in credit risk.  \nBC89. The Board acknowledges that some may claim that a gross-up \napproach should be applied to all assets, including both purchased financial \nassets and originated financial assets. This approach would recognize the credit \nrisk in the income statement over time which was not supported by either users \nor preparers. Users did not see the benefits of recognizing credit losses in the \nincome statement over time. Preparers also expressed concern at applying a \ngross-up method for both purchased financial assets and originated financial \nassets, given the complexity it would cause on how to amortize that gross-up \namount to a loan portfolio that may be changing because of prepayments, sales, \nor changes in assumptions of the credit risk in subsequent reporting periods. \nCertain supporters of a gross-up model for originated assets stated that the credit \nrisk is priced into the interest rate of those assets. The Board acknowledged this; \nhowever, it placed weight on preparers’ operability concerns as well as user \nfeedback that interest income should be recognized at the effective interest rate \nand that credit risk should be measured separately. In addition, in the definition of \npurchased financial assets with credit deterioration, the Board decided to indicate \nthat determining a purchased financial asset with credit deterioration often \npertains to acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics at \nthe date of acquisition. From a practical perspective, the Board concluded that it \nis unrealistic to expect that an entity could individually measure credit losses for \neach purchased financial asset in an asset acquisition or business combination \nwithin the reporting deadlines to determine whether each individually qualifies as \npurchased financial asset with credit deterioration. An entity should have the \nflexibility to assess whether individual financial assets or groups of financial \nassets with similar risk characteristics qualify as having experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Thus, the \ndefinition of a purchased financial asset with credit deterioration does not \npreclude application to individual assets or groups of similar assets. \nBC90. Some stakeholders requested clarification on which purchased financial \nassets should be recognized through a gross-up approach. The Board discussed \nthe definition of purchased assets with credit deterioration and did not intend for \n \n271 \nthe gross-up approach to be limited to nonaccrual loans or other assets that may \nhave been considered to be an “impaired” asset before the issuance of the \namendments in this Update. The Board was concerned that stakeholders would \nmisinterpret the guidance and apply the guidance to the same scope of assets as \nSubtopic 310-30. As a result, the Board clarified that a gross-up approach should \nbe applied to purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of \ncredit deterioration since origination. This change in wording was recommended \nby user stakeholders. In addition, the Board concluded that this will expand the \npopulation of purchased financial assets that are eligible to be considered \npurchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  \nBC91. Under current GAAP, the unit of account for purchased credit impaired \nassets can be either a group of assets or an individual asset. The Board decided \nthat the non-credit-related discount or premium for purchased financial assets \nwith credit deterioration should be allocated on an individual basis. Consistent \nwith the Board’s intent not to prescribe specific methods to measure credit \nlosses, the Board acknowledged that there could be various methods for \nallocating the non-credit-related discount or premium. \nBC92. For purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, the Board \ndecided to include additional guidance on how to determine the amortized cost \nbasis and effective interest rate due to circularity concerns. Stakeholders noted \nthat there could be a circularity issue because the amortized cost basis of the \npurchased asset with credit deterioration should include the allowance for credit \nlosses, which may not be measured until one knows the amortized cost basis. \nSimilarity, a circularity concern was expressed on determining the effective \ninterest rate when measuring expected credit losses using a discounted cash \nflow approach. Again, the effective interest rate could not be determined for the \namortized cost basis of the asset if one did not know the effective interest rate to \ndiscount the expected credit loss.  \nBC93. After receiving feedback from stakeholders on how best to \noperationalize the accounting for purchased financial assets with credit \ndeterioration, the Board decided that when using a method to estimate expected \ncredit losses that does not project future interest and principal cash flows (for \nexample, a loss rate approach), the allowance for credit losses should be based \non the unpaid principal balance (or par) amount of the asset. When using a \ndiscounted cash flow approach to estimate expected credit losses, the expected \ncredit losses should be discounted at the rate that equates the present value of \nestimated future cash flows with the purchase price of the financial asset. The \nBoard concluded that this guidance, which stakeholders did not object to, \neliminates circularity concerns and maintains the flexibility to use various \napproaches to measure credit risk. \n272 \nBeneficial Interests \nBC94. The Board decided that the gross-up model for purchased financial \nassets with credit deterioration should be applied for beneficial interests meeting \nthe definition of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, as well as \nbeneficial interests for which a significant difference exists between contractual \ncash flows and expected cash flows. The Board concluded that for certain \nbeneficial interests, investments in the residual tranche at issuance should \nqualify for the gross-up approach, although there may not be deterioration since \norigination.  \n \nBC95. The Board acknowledges that there is a difference between purchased \nassets with credit deterioration and beneficial interests in a residual tranche. \nSpecifically, for purchased assets with credit deterioration, a loss event may have \noccurred before the purchase of the assets. However, for beneficial interests in a \nresidual tranche, a loss need not have occurred for there to be a significant \ndifference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows. Therefore, \nthe Board concluded that purchased assets with credit deterioration and \nbeneficial interests pose the same core issue, that is, whether it is inappropriate \nto recognize interest income on the basis of contractual cash flows if there is a \nsignificant difference between the contractual cash flows and what is expected at \ninitial recognition of the asset. As a result, the Board decided that the model for \npurchased assets with credit deterioration should be applied to beneficial \ninterests for which a significant difference exists between contractual and \nexpected cash flows and the discount attributable to credit losses at the date of \nacquisition should not be accreted into interest income. \n \nBC96. The Board also acknowledges that practice related to interest income \nrecognition on beneficial interests within the scope of Subtopic 325-40 will be \ndifferent when an allowance for credit losses is present. When a beneficial \ninterest within the scope of Subtopic 325-40 has an allowance for credit losses, \nfavorable or unfavorable changes in cash flows must first be considered as \nadjustments to the allowance for credit losses. Only the remaining portion of \nfavorable or unfavorable changes in cash flows would be reflected in accretable \nyield. \n \nFinancial Guarantees \n \nBC97. The Board decided that off-balance-sheet credit exposures not \naccounted for as insurance contracts are within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. \nThis includes financial guarantees and other similar instruments, except for \ninstruments within the scope of Topic 815 on derivatives and hedging. Topic 460 \nrequires a liability to be initially recognized for the fair value of a guarantee \nliability, which is applicable to both financial and nonfinancial guarantees. The \n \n273 \nBoard concluded that the accounting for nonfinancial guarantees should not be \naffected by this Update (that is, no bifurcation of the contingent and \nnoncontingent aspects of a guarantee is necessary). However, for financial \nguarantees within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, an entity must account for \nexpected credit losses (as determined using the guidance in Subtopic 326-20) in \naddition to and separately from the fair value of the guarantee (as determined \nusing the guidance in Subtopic 460-10). This approach is necessary to \nappropriately present expected credit losses on financial guarantees in \naccordance with Subtopic 326-20 without affecting fee recognition, similar to \nunfunded loan commitments.  \nInterest Income Recognition \nBC98. The existing interest income recognition method for loans (other than \npurchased financial assets with credit deterioration) is based on the initial \ninvestment without deducting the allowance for credit losses, which may allow \ncertain entities to continue to recognize interest income on principal that is not \nexpected to be collected. Regulatory instructions for certain financial institutions \ncurrently mitigate this concern by requiring that interest accrual cease when \ncollection of principal, interest, or both becomes doubtful (so-called nonaccrual \npractices that are permissible under GAAP).  \nBC99. In the May 2010 proposed Update, the Board proposed that interest \nincome should always be calculated on the basis of the amortized cost less any \nallowance for credit impairments of the financial asset. This proposed change \nwas strongly opposed by many stakeholders, including preparers, some auditors, \nregulators, and many investors. Stakeholders noted that the existing approach to \nrecognizing interest income and credit losses separately provides users with \nrelevant information about the credit risk of the underlying assets. Interest \nincome is greater for riskier assets, and seeing an increase in interest income \nthat is not reflected in comparable peers gives users insight into the financial \ninstitution’s current credit lending practices. Users consistently asserted that \ninterest income should not be further diluted for changes in cash flows related to \ncredit losses. Therefore, in its redeliberations, the Board decided not to amend \nthe guidance on interest income recognition in GAAP. The Board decided as a \nresult of feedback received that existing nonaccrual practices may continue and \ndecided to exclude from the amendments in this Update the nonaccrual guidance \nthat was proposed as part of the December 2012 Exposure Draft. Respondents \nto the nonaccrual guidance proposed in the December 2012 Exposure Draft \nexpressed concern that the guidance could add complexity for certain financial \nassets that currently are not placed on nonaccrual, such as credit cards. \nAdditionally, there was concern about possible application inconsistencies with \nthe proposed nonaccrual guidance proposed in the December 2012 Exposure \nDraft and regulatory guidance.  \n274 \nModifications \nBC100. Under GAAP, the accounting by a creditor for a modification to an \nexisting financial asset depends on whether the modification qualifies as a \ntroubled debt restructuring. The Board concluded that the economic concession \ngranted by a creditor in a troubled debt restructuring reflects the creditor’s effort \nto maximize its recovery of the original contractual cash flows in a financial asset. \nAs a result, unlike more than minor modifications that do not qualify as troubled \ndebt restructurings, the Board views the modified financial asset following a \ntroubled debt restructuring as a continuation of the original financial asset.  \nBC101. While recognizing that the economic concession granted to the \nborrower may manifest itself in either (or both) a change in the contractual \ninterest or a change in principal terms, the Board concluded that the concession \nin a troubled debt restructuring is granted as a result of the borrower’s credit \nissues. As noted previously, the Board decided that the credit loss measure \nshould not reflect changes in market rates of interest, and, therefore, it decided to \nuphold the discounting factor when a discounted cash flow method is used (that \nis, the expected future cash flows should be discounted at the financial asset’s \noriginal effective interest rate). In the Board’s view, the modified financial asset \nfollowing a troubled debt restructuring is a continuation of the original financial \nasset, and, therefore, the Board concluded that, within the context of the \namortized cost framework, the effective interest rate on a financial asset following \na troubled debt restructuring should be the financial asset’s pre-modification \noriginal effective interest rate (as opposed to a post-troubled-debt-restructuring \nmodified rate).  \nBC102. The Board considered various alternatives relating to the cost basis \nadjustment for the economic concession and the consideration of prepayments in \nthe cost basis adjustment upon the execution of a troubled debt restructuring. \nBC103. The Board concluded that when a creditor modifies a financial asset in a \ntroubled debt restructuring, it forgoes its unconditional right to the original \ncontractual cash flows and, instead, accepts a modified series of contractual \ncash flows that constitute the legal contractual arrangement with the borrower. \nThe Board considered an approach where upon a troubled debt restructuring, the \ncost basis of the asset would be adjusted as a writeoff through the allowance for \nexpected credit losses so that the effective interest rate (post-troubled-debt-\nrestructuring modified rate) is the same as the original effective interest rate, \ngiven the new series of contractual cash flows. The cost-basis adjustment would \nhave been calculated as the amortized cost basis before modification less the \npresent value of the modified contractual cash flows (discounted at the original \neffective interest rate). The cost-basis adjustment would have been based on \n(and amortized over) the expected life, considering prepayment expectations. \nChanges in prepayment expectations would have been reflected as a \n \n275 \nprospective yield adjustment to address operability concerns with adjusting the \ncost basis to an amount that reflects the original contractual yield.  \nBC104. The Board received feedback that a cost basis adjustment would add \nsignificant cost and complexity to accounting for troubled debt restructurings. \nConcerns specifically focused on tracking cost basis adjustments separately from \nnet fees and costs (because prepayments are not considered for those items) \nand the need to continually adjust the accretion of the cost basis adjustment \neach reporting period. As a result of complexity and operability concerns \nassociated with the accounting for a cost-basis adjustment, the Board concluded \nthat the concession should be recorded through the allowance for credit losses \nwith no requirement to record a cost basis adjustment. \nBC105. Separately, the Board rejected an approach that would have required \nexpected credit losses on troubled debt restructurings to always be measured by \nusing a discounted cash flow method on an individual basis because such a \nrequirement would be inconsistent with the ability to estimate expected credit \nlosses using approaches other than a discounted cash flow method for assets \nmeasured at amortized cost. This decision allows entities to assess credit risk on \ntroubled debt restructurings individually, or in a pool using other expected credit \nloss methods such as loss rates. Entities may provide modification programs to \ntroubled borrowers that meet certain characteristics of financial difficulties, such \nthat the loan modifications may be easily pooled together to assess credit risk. \nTo the extent that those estimates may be more easily determinable with \napproaches other than the discounted cash flow method, the Board preferred to \nprovide that flexibility. \nDisclosure \nBC106. The Board concluded that financial statement disclosures should \nprovide information that is useful in analyzing an entity’s exposures to credit risk \nand the measurement of credit losses. Accordingly, the required financial \nstatement disclosures are intended to enable users of the financial statements in \nunderstanding (a) the credit risk inherent in the portfolio and how management \nmonitors the credit quality of the portfolio, (b) management’s estimate of \nexpected credit losses, and (c) changes in the estimate of expected credit losses \nthat have taken place during the period. \nBC107. The financial statement disclosures required by this Update retain many \nof the existing disclosures of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-20, \nReceivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing \nReceivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses, particularly those about an \nentity’s credit risk exposures and its evaluation of the appropriateness of the \nallowance for credit losses. The amendments in this Update continue to require \nan entity to provide information either by portfolio segments or by classes of \nfinancial assets. The Board concluded that when disclosing information by \n276 \nportfolio segment or class of financial asset, an entity should determine, in light of \nthe facts and circumstances, how much detail it must provide and how it \ndisaggregates information into segments or classes for assets with different risk \ncharacteristics. An entity must strike a balance between obscuring important \ninformation as a result of too much aggregation and overburdening financial \nstatements with excessive detail that may not assist financial statement users in \nunderstanding the entity’s financial assets and allowance for expected credit \nlosses.  \nBC108. While the Board chose to retain many existing financial statement \ndisclosures about an entity’s allowance for credit losses, the change from an \nincurred to an expected loss model introduces the need for additional \ndisclosures, most notably those about the inputs used to estimate expected \ncredit losses. Requiring an entity to use expected loss data when determining \nexpected credit losses will require the entity to incorporate new types of \ninformation into its measurement of expected credit losses and increase the \nsignificance of forward-looking information and its judgment in calculating the \nallowance for expected credit losses on its financial assets. As a result, the \nBoard concluded that users will benefit from understanding how an entity derives \nand uses this information.  \nBC109. The amendments in this Update require an entity to record the \namortized cost basis for purchased assets with credit deterioration as the sum of \nthe purchase price and the allowance for credit losses. In addition, an entity is \nnot allowed to recognize as interest income the discount attributable to credit. \nBecause of those amendments, the Board concluded that it is necessary to \nreconcile the amount paid for the purchased financial asset with credit \ndeterioration to the asset’s par value, particularly to provide transparency about \nthe discount inherent in the asset’s purchase price due to expected credit losses.  \nBC110. Furthermore, the December 2012 Exposure Draft initially would have \nrequired rollforward disclosures for financial assets, particularly an incremental \ndisclosure that would have required a rollforward of the amortized cost basis of \nfinancial assets.  \nBC111. Users of financial statements supported those rollforward disclosures \nbecause those disclosures would have provided information to aid in users’ \nunderstanding of how current-period originations affected the allowance for \nexpected credit losses. User respondents also provided feedback that \ndisclosures were needed to separately present the portion of the credit loss \nexpense that relates to current-period originations. Users were interested in this \ninformation because it would increase their ability to understand the credit quality \nof originations by period and assess the interrelationship of credit quality and \nloan growth. It also would provide information that could be used to understand \nthe extent the allowance has changed as a result of changes in estimates on \nloans originated in prior periods.  \n \n277 \nBC112. The Board received significant opposition to these disclosures from \npreparer respondents. Preparers challenged the usefulness of an amortized cost \nrollforward disclosure when analyzing credit quality. Preparers highlighted that \nthe allowance for expected credit losses would be estimated as of the end of a \nreporting period. Originations presented in an amortized cost basis rollforward \nmay have been partially or fully repaid during the reporting period and, therefore, \nthe relationship between originations and the current-period credit loss expense \ndetermined as of the reporting date may not always be meaningful information. \nPreparers also highlighted significant costs that would be incurred to adjust their \nexternal financial reporting systems to track the high volume of daily cash flow \nactivity of various types of loans, particularly for those with multiple products in \nvarious jurisdictions. Preparers also stated that it is unclear when draw-downs on \nrevolving lines of credit would be classified as an origination in the amortized cost \nbasis rollforward. The underwriting decisions for various revolving lines of credit \nmay have occurred many periods before the date they were drawn, so the \norigination information may not align with the time period of the credit decisions. \nAlternatively, if a line of credit was drawn down and then fully repaid in the same \nreporting period, there would be an origination to report in the amortized cost \nrollforward that is unrelated to the allowance determined based on the amortized \ncost at the reporting date; with variations of these facts patterns exacerbating the \ncomplexity of this disclosure. \nBC113. Preparers opposed a requirement to disclose separately the credit loss \nexpense that is attributable to originations. They stated that the allowance for \ncredit losses is determined at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, \nwould result in highly subjective estimates needed to allocate the total credit loss \nexpense to current-period originations and changes in estimates of previously \noriginated assets. Allocations would be highly subjective because pools may \nhave loans originated in various periods. Alternatively, expected credit loss \nestimates may comprise both quantitative and qualitative factors that take into \naccount their loans portfolios, current methodologies, and systems and \nprocesses. Those components of the estimate could be allocated to an \norigination, but the allocation methodology would be highly subjective and \narbitrary to such an extent that the costs of preparing that disclosure may not \njustify the added benefits. \nBC114. The Board understands the informational needs of the user respondents \nand the operability constraints of preparers to provide this information. As a \nresult, the Board decided to require that the existing credit quality disclosures of \nthe amortized cost basis for financing receivables and net investment in leases \nbe presented in greater detail by vintage year of origination for public business \nentities. The Board performed extensive outreach on the disclosure requirements \nafter hosting a roundtable meeting to listen to the perspectives of both preparers \nand users. Preparers indicated that vintage-year disclosures are more operable \nthan amortized cost basis rollforward disclosures, and users supported the \nadditional information that would be provided by vintage disclosures about credit \n278 \nquality trends. The Board concluded that the vintage disclosure requirements for \nfinancing receivables and net investment in leases will allow users to understand \nthe credit quality trends within the portfolio from period to period. In addition, by \nutilizing information disclosed in other areas in the financial statements and \nassumptions from public sources, users may be able to derive their own \nrollforward of the balances and related allowance for credit losses for each \norigination year. This will provide useful information because it will help users \ndevelop estimates of (a) originations by period for each class of financing \nreceivable, (b) an estimate of the initially expected credit losses and subsequent \nchanges to the estimate, and (c) an estimate of the current-period provision that \nis attributable to originations and changes in expected credit losses on previously \noriginated loans. This disclosure requirement is applicable to public business \nentities only because investors in private companies generally have greater \naccess to management to obtain the information they believe is necessary. The \nBoard considered exempting public business entities that are not SEC filers \nbecause small community banks may meet the public business entity definition, \nbut the Board concluded that a distinction among public business entities (that is, \npublic business entities that are not SEC filers) is inappropriate. The Board \nbelieves the disclosures are relevant for users in all public business entities; \nhowever, given cost considerations, the Board decided to allow public business \nentities that are not SEC filers further transition relief in order to prepare for the \ndisclosure requirements and decided not to require this disclosure for entities that \nare not public business entities. \nTransition \nBC115. The Board decided that the amendments in this Update should be \napplied on a modified-retrospective transition approach that would require a \ncumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the statement of \nfinancial position as of the date of adoption. The Board rejected other methods, \nincluding methods that would have required full retrospective transition. The \nBoard acknowledges that retrospective transition methods generally provide the \nmost useful information. However, the Board determined them to be \nimpracticable to apply in prior periods because the use of hindsight would be \nnecessary in making estimates of expected credit losses. Stakeholders generally \nagreed with a modified-retrospective transition approach.  \nBC116. Stakeholders requested additional transition guidance for certain debt \nsecurities and those financial assets that would meet the criteria of purchased \nfinancial assets with credit deterioration. For example, questions were raised \nabout whether an allowance would be recorded for a debt security that had an \nOTTI before the effective date, which may result in a reversal of a previous write-\ndown that was in accordance with previous GAAP. In addition, if an allowance \nwas recorded, preparers would have to use hindsight to determine the write-\ndown amount, if applicable. In response to stakeholders’ feedback, the Board \n \n279 \nprovided transition relief to debt securities that had OTTIs in accordance with \nprevious GAAP and for purchased financial assets that were within the scope of \nSubtopic 310-30, including those that applied Subtopic 310-30 by analogy.  \nBC117. The Board required a prospective transition approach for debt securities \nfor which an OTTI was recorded before the effective date for the reasons noted \nabove. The effect of a prospective transition approach is to maintain the same \namortized cost basis before and after the effective date of this Update. Because \nthe amortized cost basis of the debt security will not change, the effective interest \nrate on a security is not expected to change as a result of the adoption of this \nUpdate. Amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive \nincome as of the effective date that relate to improvements in cash flows will \ncontinue to be accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the debt \nsecurity on a level-yield basis. Any improvements in cash flows of a security \nbecause of improvements in credit after the adoption date are recorded in the \nincome statement in the period they are received. If cash flows are expected to \ndecrease because of a deterioration in credit expectations, an allowance should \nbe recorded based on the amendments in this Update that are included in \nSection 326-20-30 or Section 326-30-35. This approach simplified the \nsubsequent accounting for preparers and was favored by users because the \nyields on the securities continue to be comparable from one reporting period to \nthe next.     \nBC118. The Board also provided transition relief for purchased assets that were \npreviously accounted for based on the guidance in Subtopic 310-30, including \nwhen Subtopic 310-30 had been applied by analogy. Stakeholders raised \nconcerns that the criteria for a purchased credit impaired asset under Subtopic \n310-30 differed from the criteria for a purchased financial asset with credit \ndeterioration under the amendments in this Update, which would have required \npreparers to re-evaluate all purchased assets at adoption to determine whether \nupon acquisition they would have been accounted for under the new guidance of \npurchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The Board generally expects \nthat the population of purchased assets accounted for under Subtopic 310-30 will \nfall within the scope of the amendments in this Update on purchased financial \nassets with credit deterioration. Therefore, the Board provided transition relief \nthat purchased assets accounted for under Subtopic 310-30 should be reflected \nas purchased assets with credit deterioration under Topic 326. The Board also \nextended this transition relief to those purchased assets accounted for under \nSubtopic 310-30 by analogy for generally the same reasons and to further reduce \nthe cost and complexity of implementation of Topic 326. However, in providing \nthis transition relief, the Board has not permitted preparers to perform further \nassessments to determine whether other purchased financial assets that exist as \nof the date of adoption of the amendments in this Update meet the new criteria \nunder Topic 326. \nBC119.  Stakeholders also raised concerns that they would need to re-amortize \nthe purchased financial assets with credit deterioration at the adoption date to \n280 \nreflect the amendments in this Update on a modified retrospective basis. The \nBoard concluded that the benefits do not justify the costs for preparers to \nundergo this process and, instead, provided incremental transition relief for this \nissue. The Board decided that the financial assets accounted for under Subtopic \n310-30 would be considered purchased assets with credit deterioration at the \nadoption date, resulting in an adjustment to the amortized cost that reflects the \naddition of the allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption. The noncredit \ndiscount or premium, after the gross-up adjustment, should be accreted or \namortized to interest income using the interest method based on the effective \ninterest rate at the date of adoption. Therefore, there is no need to roll forward a \nnew amortized cost basis from the date of acquisition. In this decision, the Board \nconsidered users’ feedback that there was a preference to see yields on a \ncomparable basis upon transition to Topic 326.   \nBC120. The Board also notes that certain beneficial interests also apply the \nsame guidance as is applied to purchased financial assets with credit \ndeterioration. To the extent applicable, those beneficial interests should be \nprovided the same transition reliefs. \nEffective Date \nBC121. The Board decided that for public business entities that are SEC filers, \nthe amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after \nDecember 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The \nBoard decided that an effective date greater than two years after issuance of this \nUpdate will provide these entities with sufficient time to implement the \namendments. The Board considered not only the adoption timeline for preparers, \nbut also the timeline of bank regulators and practitioners who will need time to \nprepare for implementation before the Update becomes effective. \nBC122. For all other public business entities, the amendments in this Update \nare effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim \nperiods within those fiscal years. The Board concluded that an additional year of \nimplementation is appropriate for those entities that are non-SEC filers because \nthey are generally more resource constrained than SEC filers. The Board \nacknowledges that adoption of the amendments in this Update will require \nsignificant effort from the financial industry and that many financial institutions \nmeet the public business entity definition set in GAAP. Therefore, a line between \npublic business entities and all other entities was not practical. To give small \nfinancial institutions additional time to prepare for adoption, the Board decided \nthat a better threshold would be SEC filing status. \nBC123. For all other entities, including not-for-profit entities and employee \nbenefit plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan accounting, the \namendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after \nDecember 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after \n \n281 \nDecember 15, 2021. This is consistent with the Private Company Decision-\nMaking Framework, which suggests that the effective date of an Update for \nprivate companies should be a minimum of one year after the effective date for \npublic companies. In making this decision, the Board observed that (a) some \npreparers and auditors of private company financial statements rely on the \nexperience of public entities and their auditors when implementing a new \nstandard and (b) the education cycle for preparers of private company financial \nstatements generally occurs once per year—typically during the second half of \nthe year. Furthermore, private companies generally have fewer resources than \npublic entities and, consequently, will benefit from having additional time to \nevaluate the effects of the amendments in this Update. In deciding to set the \neffective date for private companies as of the end of the initial annual reporting \nperiod, the Board considered the factor in the Private Company Decision-Making \nFramework that indicates that private companies generally should not be \nrequired to adopt new requirements during an interim period within the fiscal year \nof adoption. \nBC124. The Private Company Decision-Making Framework indicates that, \ngenerally, private companies should be permitted to adopt the amendments \nbefore the deferred effective date for private companies, but no earlier than the \nrequired or permitted effective date for public companies. In addition, this \napproach provides a private company with the flexibility to achieve comparability \nof its financial statements with public company financial statements.  \nBC125. Stakeholder feedback indicated that comparability for adoption was \ncritical because users, regulators, and other stakeholders would have difficulty \ncomparing financial results of different financial institutions if adoption did not \noccur at the same time. In addition, regulators and practitioners needed time to \nprepare to assist in a successful implementation of the amendments in this \nUpdate.  \nBC126. Initially, the Board determined the effective dates to be one year earlier \nthan the respective dates mentioned above. However, the final issuance of this \nUpdate occurred later than the Board expected because additional outreach was \nperformed. Therefore, in consideration of the Private Company Decision-Making \nFramework and the Board’s reconsideration of the effective dates to the effective \ndates mentioned above, the Board decided that all entities may adopt the \namendments in this Update as of fiscal years beginning after December 15, \n2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is not \npermitted. \nSimilarities and Differences with IFRS 9 \nBC127. The FASB and the IASB jointly deliberated improvements to financial \ninstruments impairment models through 2012. Both Boards sought to respond to \n282 \nconcerns identified by the FCAG following the financial crisis pertaining to \ndelayed recognition of credit losses. \nBC128. The FASB understands the desire for a converged model. However, in \nresponse to differing feedback received on the joint Supplementary Document, \nthe FASB decided to continue to develop the CECL model, which was exposed \nin the December 2012 Exposure Draft. The FASB and IASB received different \nfeedback on their respective proposed credit loss models. The IASB \nstakeholders strongly preferred an impairment model that utilizes a dual \nmeasurement approach, while U.S. stakeholders strongly preferred the CECL \nmodel proposed by the FASB. \nBC129. Because of the importance of stakeholders’ input and the different \nfeedback that each respective Board received, convergence was unachievable. It \nwas identified that: \na. Before the issuance of IFRS 9 and the amendments in this Update, the \npractices for accounting for credit losses were different between GAAP \nand IFRS preparers. The FASB and the IASB concluded that the \npreexisting differences influenced stakeholders’ perceptions of the two \nmodels. \nb. The interaction between the role of prudential regulators and loss \nallowances determined for financial reporting purposes is historically \nstronger in the United States.  \nc. Many users of financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP \nplace greater weight on the loss allowances on the balance sheet. \n \nBC130. The issue of convergence was discussed at length throughout the \nproject. However, after considering the differences in feedback received, the \nFASB continued with the CECL model that was proposed in the December 2012 \nExposure Draft.   \nBC131. A few notable similarities and differences between the CECL model and \nIFRS 9 are summarized below: \na. Both the CECL model and IFRS 9 are considered to be expected credit \nloss models. The CECL model requires that the full amount of expected \ncredit losses be recorded for all financial assets measured at amortized \ncost, whereas IFRS 9 requires that an allowance for credit losses equal \nto the 12-month expected credit losses as defined in IFRS 9 be \nrecognized, until there is a significant increase in credit risk when \nlifetime expected credit losses are recognized. \nb. Under IFRS 9, the full amount of expected credit losses is measured for \nfinancial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit \nrisk since initial recognition. For these assets, there may be similar \nmeasurements of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 and CECL \nbecause, under both, an entity will measure credit losses over the \nexpected life, subject to key differences highlighted below. \n \n283 \nc. The amendments in this Update have different requirements based on \nthe measurement attribute. Specifically, different considerations and \nindicators for impairment exist for available-for-sale debt securities. \nIFRS 9 requires one credit loss approach for all financial assets \n(described as fair value through other comprehensive income assets \nunder IFRS 9), regardless of the measurement attribute.  \nd. The FASB acknowledges the time value of money is implicitly present in \ncredit loss methodologies using amortized cost information, whereas \nIFRS 9 requires an explicit consideration of the time value of money.    \ne. The CECL model requires collective evaluation of credit losses when \nsimilar risk characteristics exist. IFRS 9 states that the measurement of \nexpected credit losses shall reflect a probability-weighted amount but \nparticular measurement techniques are not prescribed. Therefore, IFRS \n9 allows collective evaluation of credit losses based on shared risk \ncharacteristics; however, unlike the CECL model, the probability \nweighted outcomes must be considered. \nf. GAAP treats a concession provided to a troubled borrower to be a \ncontinuation of the original lending agreement. Differences exist for \nmodifications of financial assets and the concept of a troubled debt \nrestructuring does not exist in IFRS 9.  \ng. Differences exist for purchased financial assets. IFRS 9 also includes \nrequirements for originated credit impaired financial assets as well as \npurchased credit impaired financial assets. GAAP does not contain \nprovisions for originated impaired financial assets, and there are \ndifferences in the scope and measurement of expected credit losses for \npurchased financial assets. \nh. GAAP continues to permit the application of nonaccrual practices, \nwhereas IFRS 9 continues to preclude the use of nonaccrual practices. \nIFRS 9 requires a net-interest approach to be applied to the “Stage 3” \nassets, which represent individual assets that are credit impaired, \nwhereas a gross interest approach is used otherwise. \ni. The discount rate utilized when a discounted cash flow approach is \nused under the CECL model is required to be the effective interest rate. \nIFRS 9 provides that an entity also is permitted to use an approximation \nof the effective discount rate when discounting expected credit losses. \nj. The CECL model requires expected credit losses for unfunded \ncommitments to reflect the full contractual period over which an entity is \nexposed to credit risk via a present obligation to extend credit. The \nCECL model does not require an allowance for expected credit losses \nbeyond the contractual term or beyond the point in which a loan \ncommitment may be unconditionally cancelled by the issuer. In contrast, \nfor a financial asset that contains both a loan and an undrawn \ncommitment component, IFRS 9 states that an entity should measure \nexpected credit losses over the period that an entity is exposed to credit \nrisk and expected credit losses are not mitigated by credit risk \n284 \nmanagement actions, even if that period extends beyond the maximum \ncontractual period.  \nk. The CECL model requires the amortized cost basis of financing \nreceivables and net investment in leases to be disclosed by credit \nquality indicator, disaggregated by year of origination. This information \nis intended to help users understand the credit quality trends within the \nportfolio from period to period. IFRS 9 requires an entity to disclose a \nreconciliation of the financial assets relating to the allowance for credit \nlosses from the opening balance to the closing balance and requires \nexplanations of how significant changes in the gross carrying amounts \nof financial assets during the period contributed to the changes in the \nallowance for credit losses.  \n \n285 \nAmendments to the XBRL Taxonomy \nThe amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification® in this \nAccounting Standards Update require changes to the U.S. GAAP Financial \nReporting Taxonomy (Taxonomy). Those changes, which will be incorporated \ninto the proposed 2017 Taxonomy, are available for public comment through \nASU Taxonomy Changes provided at www.fasb.org, and finalized as part of the \nannual release process. \n ","startPage":241,"endPage":245,"firstLine":"978-310-35-6 Amended 2016-13 06/16/2016 ","willIgnore":false}},"conceptIndex":{"Real Estate
