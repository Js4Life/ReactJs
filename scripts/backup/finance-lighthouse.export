Entity A\ufffds unrealized loss on investments in corporate \u000abonds relates to a $150 investment in Entity B\ufffds Series C Debentures. Entity \u000aB is a manufacturer. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by a recent \u000adecrease in profitability and near-term profit forecasts by industry analysts \u000aresulting from intense competitive pricing pressure in the manufacturing \u000aindustry and a recent sector downgrade by several industry analysts. The \u000acontractual terms of those investments do not permit Entity B to settle the \u000asecurity at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment. \u000aWhile Entity B\ufffds credit rating has decreased from A to BBB (Standard & \u000aPoor\ufffds), Entity A currently does not expect Entity B to settle the debentures \u000aat a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investment (that is, Entity \u000aA expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security). \u000aBecause Entity A does not intend to sell the investment and it is not more \u000alikely than not that Entity A will be required to sell the investment before \u000arecovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, it does not \u000aconsider the investment in Entity B\ufffds debentures to be other-than-temporarily \u000a79 \u000aAmendments to Subtopic 323-10 \u000a15.

As part of this analysis, Community \u000aBank A observed that real estate values in the community have decreased and \u000athe unemployment rate in the community has increased as of the current \u000a130 \u000areporting period date.

To adjust the historical loss rate to reflect the effects of those differences \u000ain current conditions and forecasted changes, Community Bank A estimates a \u000a10-basis-point increase in credit losses incremental to the 1.5 percent historical \u000alifetime loss rate due to the expected decrease in real estate values and a 5-\u000abasis-point increase in credit losses incremental to the historical lifetime loss rate \u000adue to expected deterioration in unemployment rates.

It is usually difficult, even with hindsight, to identify any single event that \u000amade a particular loan uncollectible.
